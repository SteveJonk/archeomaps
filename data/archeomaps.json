Most archaeologists believe that Machu Picchu was built as an estate for the Inca emperor Pachacuti (1438–1472). Often referred to as the \"City of the Incas\", it is perhaps the most familiar icon of the Inca World. Although mainstream science debates that the site was built around 1400, there is clear evidence they rebuilt on the foundations of a pre-incan civilisation.<br> <br>http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machu_Picchu<br><br><img src=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/umsh/AK-S7uGJwkre7XuVfHYmZXGXTwr6iqVCltf1yjVvoGXY1NJBxJeSe3ZlVwwuxqZWU2T7K_7N4ZDrCdFvMLbC8h_gzg3m1M-Teh37RLw2F3-1nJjNyQsz96BLwqth99WtlWHS7Gf-DNn5p1CHl-Oy\" height=\"200\" width=\"auto\" /><br><br><img src=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/umsh/AK-S7uE0E0Ip6FDbwcadyq6cE5ZIFNruJD4RkCPErp9uQCsEMqIB89GgOprsZ8drLOpaOjkwHDKL_bIjZNrszkLH0Pg3E263PFV45QChC6cVdgr5Fcqgx0CjN2OgHpQWQ3YxvgOWFHgRtbn729Tv3wyg-iOMZQ\" height=\"200\" width=\"auto\" /><br><br><img src=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/umsh/AK-S7uF3B4ru-mMO6g9iLQano_xkEP28gAn-4x9aLkh0RwuXddVGQ4a0wkBd52PXl3SJfMVJQvpD1nC8BkbT3fmLv8qq89vzOIqiAD4I1xARZdi0ZasTCq8I5OlAsHRiiItIqkvxK9kj2Q\" height=\"200\" width=\"auto\" /><br><br><img src=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/umsh/AK-S7uF-lfbqXncFQ9UvR0l_gprMF31I90BYB_WtNO0BWDeT7JEkwUbnDmSGxAMyVCXg6NL5Mm8IVkQQ_oae1K3yJrx7EOy0NA0R8G96oNkP4jVRth4jkhljrdbAszlcbNJnhuUUB_XCbUjYDmItkRUBHFqOYOirI31clF524CrV9MpnzOE5tk2uKMZhGedwqP7GNKWrKDek7JZK0vDqkzHykqae7pLTmka8jLhzNbh4HCw4Qj55hbEITuCOAusr_l0\" height=\"200\" width=\"auto\" /><br><br><img src=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/umsh/AK-S7uFS9Cvbr8soMkQUga8eijHef1MVXsl-D_XhPek3HIGTRDezjlKRiaUMb-cZLroHtxfFwSa2LV19lnFfPqEmWYxoAzxzHt-eqMpSvJvgx1xcmhr-vbwd-53GcvzeEsTVVEzcUpAe1oik2jhHX7QOFQKdc4iBk-yZ7klLBuSqmHmMt-3YtvdsHK7J\" height=\"200\" width=\"auto\" />",

Apart from the pyramids, Teotihuacan is also anthropologically significant for its complex, multi-family residential compounds, the Avenue of the Dead, and the small portion of its vibrant murals that have been exceptionally well-preserved. Additionally, Teotihuacan exported a so-called \"Thin Orange\" pottery style and fine obsidian tools that garnered high prestige and widespread utilization throughout Mesoamerica.The city is thought to have been established around 100 BC, with major monuments continuously under construction until about AD 250. The city may have lasted until sometime between the 7th and 8th centuries AD, but its major monuments were sacked and systematically burned around 550 AD.<br><br>http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teotihuacan<br><br><img src=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/umsh/AK-S7uG-gZO5v1jYvqBUys80-PkbdtnAIyTmEFNTWTzraaK7Sg78vFTXmHPhEpckeFTyl0YohWmQWa3cdKaKuxd2XcrE8oIKWFeNTXgHugF8IuxwPgpR1J56u7-OaVVooas\" height=\"200\" width=\"auto\" /><br><br><img src=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/umsh/AK-S7uHW03Ilcei8c8C9CQxtmq_VwQQs5zS_FAy8kVTeaBIFHt5P8PlsnyEBoYx9cC9TcFnTa-gsG7u5E0K2vxW0sQgQpKnX_4V_2GEb3YTl_YmCCFtuHAvSL89RfaJ2Qn9kHzl64s2KnYK1sw\" height=\"200\" width=\"auto\" /><br><br><img src=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/umsh/AK-S7uG59iSPeNuuwCs-V4OME4_hPrFHwndrag1jipLOqHluukCg-_06wFetWohhfIxtcmdG0DcgOCKXKcaYqnrjs0YU90l3W-D1-PVRYbZ21648xBuF7-Rp6rp8eesjzkBlj3AEFTdYkwM\" height=\"200\" width=\"auto\" /><br><br><img src=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/umsh/AK-S7uElmIncMaPbHvlRp9bE1xBYZMjXZUXV95mDpu5jXPyrtEKE4ZYFZvypXZJTRP45WR-x7pMpxTEBOYdrUEWChlEF8CF3fNzKR5pc_rOEtk9Qn2VlbtoPKLaePbMKfEeVW110yGi_Qw\" height=\"200\" width=\"auto\" />",

        "description": "Pumapunku also called \"Puma Pumku\" or \"Puma Puncu\", is part of a large temple complex or monument group that is part of the Tiwanaku Site near Tiwanaku, Bolivia. Tiwanaku is signifigant in Incan traditions because it is believed to be the site where the world was created. In Aymara, Puma Punku's name means, \"The Door of the Puma\". The Pumapunku complex consists of an unwalled western court, a central unwalled esplanade, a terraced platform mound that is faced with megalithic stone, and a walled eastern court.<br><br><br>Determining the age of the Pumapunku complex has been a focus of researchers since the discovery of the Tiwanaku site. As noted by Andean specialist, Binghamton University Anthropology professor W. H. Isbell, a radiocarbon date was obtained by Vranich from organic material from lowermost and oldest layer of mound-fill forming the Pumapunku. This layer was deposited during the first of three construction epochs and dates the initial construction of the Pumapunku at 1510 ±25 B.P. C14 (AD 440; calibrated, AD 536–600). Since the radiocarbon date came from the lowermost and oldest layer of mound-fill underlying the andesite and sandstone stonework, the stonework must have been constructed sometime after 1510 ±25 B.P. C14. The excavation trenches of Vranich show that the clay, sand, and gravel fill of the Pumapunku complex lie directly on the sterile middle Pleistocene sediments. These excavation trenches also demonstrated the lack of any pre-Andean Middle Horizon cultural deposits within the area of the Tiwanaku Site adjacent to the Pumapunku complex.<br><br>http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pumapunku"

However, human activity and overpopulation led to gradual deforestation and extinction of natural resources, which caused the demise of the Rapa Nui civilization. By the time of European arrival in 1722, the island's population had dropped to 2,000–3,000 from a high of approximately 15,000 just a century earlier. In recent times the island has served as a warning of the cultural and environmental dangers of exploitation. Diseases carried by European sailors and Peruvian slave raiding  of the 1860s further reduced the Rapa Nui population, down to 111 in 1877.<br>Easter Island is one of the most remote inhabited islands in the world. The nearest inhabited land (50 residents) is Pitcairn Island  at 2,075 kilometres (1,289 mi), and the nearest continental point lies in central Chile, at 3,512 kilometres (2,182 mi).<br><br>http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Easter_Island"

Critics argue that there is no treasure and that the pit is a natural phenomenon, likely a sinkhole.<br>There has been wide-ranging speculation amongst enthusiasts as to who originally dug the pit and what it might contain. Later accounts say that oak platforms were discovered every 10 feet (3.0 m),  but the earliest accounts simply say that \"marks\" of some type were found at these places. They also say there were \"tool marks\" or pick scrapes on the walls of the money pit and that the dirt was noticeably loose and not as hard packed as the surrounding soil. One expedition said they found the flood tunnel at 90 feet, and that it was lined with flat stones. However, Robert Dunfield (a trained geologist) wrote that he carefully examined the walls of the re-excavated pit and was unable to locate any evidence of this tunnel.<br>The cipher stone, which one researcher is said to have translated to read \"Forty feet below two million pounds is buried\", was allegedly last seen in the early 20th century (exact dates are a topic of controversy). Some accounts state that Smith used it as a fireback in his fireplace, while others claim it was last seen as a doorstep in a Halifax bookbinder's shop. The accuracy of the translation, whether the symbols as commonly depicted are accurate, or if they meant anything at all, remains disputed.<br><br> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oak_Island#The_Money_Pit"

The more than 3,000 prehistoric standing stones were hewn from local rock and erected by the pre-Celtic people of Brittany, and are the largest such collection in the world. Most of the stones are within the Breton village of Carnac, but some to the east are within La Trinité-sur-Mer. The stones were erected at some stage during the Neolithic period, probably around 3300 BC, but some may date to as old as 4500 BC.<br>Although the stones date from 4500 BC, modern myths were formed which resulted from 1st century AD Roman and later Christian occupations, such as Saint Cornelius – a Christian myth associated with the stones held that they were pagan soldiers in pursuit of Pope Cornelius when he turned them to stone. Brittany has its own local versions of the Arthurian cycle. Local tradition claims that the reason they stand in such perfectly straight lines is that they are a Roman legion turned to stone by Merlin.<br><br> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carnac_stones"

        "description": "Tiwanaku, (Spanish: Tiahuanaco and Tiahuanacu) is an important Pre-Columbian archaeological site in western Bolivia, South America. Tiwanaku is recognized by Andean scholars as one of the most important precursors to the Inca Empire, flourishing as the ritual and administrative capital of a major state power for approximately five hundred years. The ruins of the ancient city state are near the south-eastern shore of Lake Titicaca in the La Paz Department, Ingavi Province, Tiwanaku Municipality, about 72 km (45 mi) west of La Paz.<br><br>The area around Tiwanaku may have been inhabited as early as 1500 BC as a small agriculturally based village. Most research, though, is based around the Tiwanaku IV and V periods between AD 300 and AD 1000, during which Tiwanaku grew significantly in power. During the time period between 300 BC and AD 300 Tiwanaku is thought to have been a moral and cosmological center to which many people made pilgrimages. The ideas of cosmological prestige are the precursors to Tiwanaku's powerful empire. In 1945, Arthur Posnansky estimated that Tiwanaku dated to 15,000 BC using archaeoastronomical techniques. Later, as a result of the reevaluation of the techniques that Posnansky used to estimate the age of Tiwanaku, expert archaeoastronomical archaeologists concluded that they were invalid as they were a \"sorry example of misused archaeoastronomical evidence.\"<br> <br>http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tiwanaku"

The hills are located near the town of Visoko, northwest of Sarajevo. Visočica hill, where the Old town of Visoki was once sited, became the focus of international attention in October 2005, following a news-media campaign promoted by Osmanagić and his supporters.<br><br>Osmanagić claims to have found tunnels, stone blocks and ancient mortar, which he has suggested once covered the Visočica structure. He opened excavations in 2006 which have reshaped the hill, making it look like a Mayan step pyramid. Geologists, archeologists and other scientists have however concluded, after analysis of the site, its known history, and the excavations, that the hills are natural formations – so-called flatirons – and that there are no signs of human construction involved. The European Association of Archaeologists  released a statement calling the pyramids a \"scheme\" and a \"cruel hoax\".<br><br>http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Osmanagic_pyramid_hypothesis "

The city had lost its political pre-eminence by the end of the Late Classic (ca. AD 500-750) and soon thereafter was largely abandoned.

        "description": "The Parthenon is a temple on the Athenian Acropolis, Greece, dedicated to the maiden goddess Athena, whom the people of Athens considered their patron. Its construction began in 447 BC when the Athenian Empire was at the height of its power. It was completed in 438 BC, although decoration of the Parthenon continued until 432 BC. It is the most important surviving building of Classical Greece, generally considered the culmination of the development of the Doric order. Its decorative sculptures are considered some of the high points of Greek art. The Parthenon is regarded as an enduring symbol of Ancient Greece and of ancient democracy and one of the world's greatest cultural monuments. <br><br>The Parthenon itself replaced an older temple of Athena, which historians call the Pre-Parthenon or Older Parthenon, that was destroyed in the Persian invasion of 480 BC. The temple is archaeoastronomically aligned to the Hyades. Like most Greek temples, the Parthenon was used as a treasury. For a time, it served as the treasury of the Delian League, which later became the Athenian Empire. In the 5th century AD, the Parthenon was converted into a Christian church dedicated to the Virgin Mary. After the Ottoman conquest, it was turned into a mosque in the early 1460s, and it had a minaret built in it. On 26 September 1687, an Ottoman ammunition dump inside the building was ignited by Venetian bombardment. The resulting explosion severely damaged the Parthenon and its sculptures. In 1806, Thomas Bruce, 7th Earl of Elgin removed some of the surviving sculptures, with the Ottoman Turks' permission. These sculptures, now known as the Elgin Marbles or the Parthenon Marbles, were sold in 1816 to the British Museum in London, where they are now displayed. Since 1983 (on the initiative of Culture Minister Melina Mercouri), the Greek government has been committed to the return of the sculptures to Greece, so far with no success.<br><br>http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parthenon "

Here statues and monuments commemorated the city's great men. The teeming heart of ancient Rome, it has been called the most celebrated meeting place in the world, and in all history. Located in the small valley between the Palatine and Capitoline Hills, the Forum today is a sprawling ruin of architectural fragments and intermittent archeological excavations attracting numerous sightseers.<br>Many of the oldest and most important structures of the ancient city were located on or near the Forum. The Roman kingdom's earliest shrines and temples were located on the southeastern edge. These included the ancient former royal residence, the Regia (8th century BC), and the Temple of Vesta (7th century BC), as well as the surrounding complex of the Vestal Virgins, all of which were rebuilt after the rise of imperial Rome.<br><br> <br>http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_Forum"

It was one of the twelve cities of the Ionian League during the Classical Greek era. In the Roman period, Ephesus had a population of more than 250,000 in the 1st century BC, which also made it one of the largest cities in the Mediterranean world.<br><br>The city was famed for the Temple of Artemis (completed around 550 BC), one of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World. Emperor Constantine I rebuilt much of the city and erected new public baths. Following the Edict of Thessalonica from emperor Theodosius I, the temple was destroyed in 401 AD by a mob led by St. John Chrysostom. The town was partially destroyed by an earthquake in 614 AD. The city's importance as a commercial center declined as the harbor was slowly silted up by the Cayster River.<br><br>Ephesus was one of the seven churches of Asia that are cited in the Book of Revelation. The Gospel of John may have been written here. The city was the site of several 5th century Christian Councils, see Council of Ephesus. It is also the site of a large gladiators' graveyard.<br><br>http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ephesus<br>http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seven_churches_of_Asia"

The park was created in 1906 by President Theodore Roosevelt, to protect some of the best-preserved cliff<br>dwellings in the world, or as he said, \"preserve the works of man\". It occupies 81.4 square miles (211 km2) near the Four Corners and features numerous ruins of homes and villages built by the Ancestral Puebloan people, sometimes called the Anasazi. There are over 4,000 archaeological sites and over 600 cliff dwellings of the Pueblo people at the site.<br><br>The Anasazi inhabited Mesa Verde between AD 600 to 1300, though there is evidence they left before the turn of the century. They were mainly subsistence farmers, growing crops on nearby mesas. Their primary crop was corn, the major part of their diet. Men were also hunters, which further increased their food supply. The women of the Anasazi are famous for their elegant basket weaving. Anasazi pottery is as famous as their baskets; their artifacts are highly prized. The Anasazi kept no written records.<br><br>http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mesa_Verde_National_Park"

        "description": "The Dyatlov Pass incident resulted in the deaths of nine ski hikers in the northern Ural mountains on the night of February 2, 1959. It happened on the east shoulder of the mountain Kholat Syakhl (Холат-Сяхыл) (a Mansi name, meaning Mountain of the Dead). The mountain pass where the incident occurred has since been named Dyatlov Pass (Перевал Дятлова) after the group's leader, Igor Dyatlov (Игорь Дятлов).<br>The lack of eyewitnesses has inspired much speculation. Soviet investigators determined only that \"a compelling natural force\" had caused the deaths. Access to the area was barred for skiers and other adventurers for three years after the incident. The chronology of the incident remains unclear because of the lack of survivors.<br>Investigators at the time determined that the hikers tore open their tent from within, departing barefoot into heavy snow and a temperature of −30 °C (−22 °F). Although the corpses showed no signs of struggle, two victims had fractured skulls, two had broken ribs, and one was missing her tongue.<br><br> <br>http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dyatlov_Pass_incident"

        "description": "Mada'in Saleh, also called Al-Hijr or Hegra, is a pre-Islamic archaeological site located in the Al-Ula sector, within the Al Madinah Region of Saudi Arabia. A majority of the vestiges date from the Nabatean kingdom (1st century CE). The si<br>te constitutes the kingdom's southernmost and largest settlement after Petra, its capital. Traces of Lihyanite and Roman occupation before and after the Nabatean rule, respectively, can also be found in situ, while accounts from the Qur’an tell of an earlier settlement of the area by the tribe of Thamud in the 3rd millennium BC.<br><br>According to the Islamic text, the Thamudis, who would carve out homes in the mountains, were punished by Allah for their persistent practice of idol worship and for conspiring to kill she-camel (as mentioned in the Qu'ran), the non-believers being struck by an earthquake and lightning blasts. Thus, the site has earned a reputation down to contemporary times as a cursed place— an image which the national government is attempting to overcome as it seeks to develop Mada'in Saleh, officially protected as an archaeological site since 1972, for its tourism potential.<br><br>In 2008, for its well-preserved remains from late antiquity, especially the 131 rock-cut monumental tombs, with their elaborately ornamented façades, of the Nabatean kingdom, UNESCO proclaimed Mada'in Saleh as a site of patrimony, becoming Saudi Arabia's first World Heritage Site.<br> <br>http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madain_Saleh"

        "description": "Ale's Stones (or Ales stenar in Swedish) is a megalithic monument in Scania in southern Sweden. It consists of a stone ship 67 meters long formed by 59 large boulders of sandstone, weighing up to 1.8 tonnes each. According to Scanian folklore, a legendary king called King Ale lies buried there.<br>The carbon-14 dating system for organic remains has provided seven results at the site. One indicates that the material is around 5,500 years old whereas the remaining six indicate a date about 1,400 years ago. The latter is considered to be the most likely time for Ales Stenar to have been created. That would place its creation towards the end of the Nordic Iron Age.<br><br> <br>http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ale's_Stones<br>http://www.unexplained-mysteries.com/viewnews.php?id=225826"

        "description": "Studies have shown that since the 1950s or 1960s numerous dogs have leaped from the bridge at the rate of about one dog a month. Dogs that leap over the bridge parapet fall 50 feet (15 m) onto the waterfalls below. Some dogs that survived this drop, and were then taken back to the bridge, have also jumped again. The only linking factors for this unexplained event are that dogs mostly jump from the same side of the bridge, in clear weather, and they are breeds with long snouts.<br>As the unexplained phenomenon received international media attention, the Scottish SPCA sent an animal habitat expert to investigate the causes as to why dogs kill themselves at Overtoun Bridge. Initially Dr David Sands examined sight, smell and sound factors. After eliminating what a dog could potentially see and hear on the bridge, he eventually focused on scent following the discovery of mice and mink in undergrowth on the side of the bridge from which dogs often leaped. In a test, the odours from these animals were spread around an open field. Ten dogs were unleashed - representing the commonest breeds that jumped off the bridge. Of the dogs tested, only two showed no interest in any of the scents while nearly all the others made straight for the mink scent. Sands concluded that, although it was not a definitive answer, the potent odour from male mink urine was possibly luring keen-nosed dogs to their deaths.<br><br> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overtoun_House#Dog_deaths_at_Overtoun_Bridge"

The town was named after the Inca palace and temple site.<br><br>These are the largest known Inca ruins in Ecuador. The most significant building is the temple of the sun, an elliptically shaped building constructed around a large rock. The building is constructed in the Incan way without mortar in most of the complex. The stones were carefully chiseled and fashioned to fit together perfectly. The temple of the sun was positioned so that on the solstices, at exactly the right time of day, sunlight would fall through the center of the doorway of the small chamber at the top of the temple. Most of this chamber has fallen down.<br>The Incas were not the first inhabitants of Ingapirca. It had long been settled by the Cañari indigenous people, who called it Hatun Cañar.<br><br> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ingapirca"

He intended to land at King Island and return to Moorabbin Airport.<br>During the 127-mile  (235 km) flight, Valentich advised Melbourne air traffic control that he was being accompanied by an aircraft about 1,000 feet (300 m) above him.He described some unusual actions and features of the aircraft, saying that his engine had begun running roughly, and finally reported that the \"strange aircraft is hovering on top of me again. It is hovering and it's not an aircraft.\"<br>Valentich and his aircraft were never found, and an Australian Department of Transport investigation concluded that the reason for the disappearance could not be determined.<br>Belated reports of a UFO sighting in Australia on the night of the disappearance led Ken Williams, a spokesman for the Department of Transport, to tell Associated Press that \"it's funny all these people ringing up with UFO reports well after Valentich's disappearance.\"<br><br> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valentich_disappearance"

It is unknown whether these patterns have any particular meaning attached to them—many people have attempted to find information coded into them, but no interpretation has yet proven conclusive.<br>One recent attempt to make sense of the boxes has been to interpret them as a musical score. The motifs on the boxes somewhat resemble geometric patterns seen in the study of cymatics. The patterns are formed by placing powder upon a flat surface and vibrating the surface at different frequencies. By matching these Chladni patterns with musical notes corresponding to the same frequencies, the father-and-son team of Thomas and Stuart Mitchell produced a tune which Stuart calls the Rosslyn Motet.<br><br> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rosslyn_Chapel"

It is not older than 9-10 millennias, according to OSL dating of associated sediments, but could be younger. The art depicts herds of cattle, large wild animals including crocodiles, and human activities such as hunting and dancing. According to UNESCO, \"The range's exceptional density of rock art paintings-pictograms and engravings-petroglyphs, and the presence of many prehistoric vestiges, are remarkable testimonies to Neolithic prehistory. From 10,000 BCE to the first centuries CE, successive peoples left many archaeological remains, habitations, burial mounds and enclosures which have yielded abundant lithic and ceramic material. However, it is the rock art (engravings and paintings) that have made Tassili world famous as from 1933, the date of its discovery. 15,000 petroglyphs have been identified to date.\" <br><br>http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tassili_n'Ajjer"

The figure is situated on the upper slopes of White Horse Hill in the English civil parish of Uffington. <br><br>Iron Age coins that bear a representation comparable to the Uffington White Horse have been found, supporting the early dating of this artifact; it has also been suggested that the horse had been fashioned in the Anglo-Saxon period, more particularly during Alfred's reign, but there is no positive evidence to support this and the view is classified as \"folklore\" by Darvill (1996).<br>Numerous other prominent prehistoric sites are located nearby, notably Wayland's Smithy, a long barrow less than 2 kilometres (1 mi) to the west. The Uffington is by far the oldest of the white horse figures in Britain, and is of an entirely different design from the others.<br><br> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uffington_White_Horse"

        "description": "The Westbury or Bratton White Horse is a hill figure on the escarpment of Salisbury Plain, approximately 2.5 km (1.6 mi) east of Westbury in England. Located on the edge of Bratton Downs and lying just below an Iron Age hill fort, it is the oldest of several white horses carved in Wiltshire. It was restored in 1778, an action which may have obliterated a previous horse which had occupied the same slope. A contemporary engraving of the 1760s appears to show a horse facing in the opposite direction, and also rather smaller than the present figure. However, there is at present no documentary or other evidence for the existence of a chalk horse at Westbury before the year 1742.<br>The origin of the Westbury White Horse is obscure. It is often claimed to commemorate King Alfred's victory at theBattle of Eðandun in 878, and while this is not impossible, there is no trace of such a legend before the second half of the eighteenth century. It should also be noted that the battle of Eðandun has only tentatively been identified with Edington in Wiltshire.<br><br> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Westbury_White_Horse"

With its five floors extending to a depth of approximately 60 m, it was large enough to shelter approximately 20,000 people together with their livestock and food stores. It is the largest excavated underground city in Turkey and is one of several underground complexes found across Cappadocia.<br>It was opened to visitors in 1969 and to date, about half of the underground city is accessible to tourists.<br>The underground city at Derinkuyu could be closed from the inside with large stone doors. The complex has a total of 13 floors. Each floor could be closed off separately.<br>First built in the soft volcanic rock of the Cappadocia region, possibly by the Phrygians in the 8th–7th centuries B.C according to the Turkish Department of Culture, the underground city at Derinkuyu may have been enlarged in the Byzantine era.<br><br> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Derinkuyu_Underground_City"

Many structures remain from the Tellem. The Bandiagara Escarpment was listed in the UNESCO World Heritage List in 1989.<br><br>The cave-dwelling Tellem, an ethnic group later pushed out by the arrival of the Dogons, used to live in the slopes of the cliff. The Tellem legacy is evident in the caves they carved into the cliffs so that they could bury their dead high up, far from the frequent flash floods of the area. Dozens of villages are located along the cliff, such as Kani Bonzon. It was near to this village that the Dogons arrived in the 14th century, and from there they spread over the plateau, the escarpment and the plains of the Seno-Gondo.<br> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bandiagara_Escarpment<br><br>Home of the Dogon tribes, who had advanced knowledge of astronomy.<br><br>http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dogon_people#Dogon_and_Sirius"

It is carved out of a cliff face that lies at the confluence of the Minjiang, Dadu and Qingyi rivers in the southern part of Sichuan province in China, near the city of <br>Leshan. The stone sculpture faces Mount Emei, with the rivers flowing below his feet. It is the largest stone Buddha in the world and it is by far the tallest pre-modern statue in the world.<br> <br>Construction was started in 713, led by a Chinese monk named Haitong. He hoped that the Buddha would calm the turbulent waters that plagued the shipping vessels traveling down the river. When funding for the project was threatened, he is said to have gouged out his own eyes to show his piety and sincerity. After his death, however, the construction was stuck due to insufficient funding. About 70 years later, a jiedushi decided to sponsor the project and the construction was completed by Haitong's disciples in 803.<br><br>Apparently the massive construction resulted in so much stone being removed from the cliff face and deposited into the river below that the currents were indeed altered by the statue, making the waters safe for passing ships.<br><br>http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leshan_Giant_Buddha"

        "description": "The Kanheri Caves constitute a group of rock-cut monuments that are located north of Borivali on the western outskirts of Mumbai, India. Deep within the green forests of the Sanjay Gandhi National Park, the caves are 6 km from the main gate & 7 km from Borivali Station. Tourists can enter after 7:30 a.m. The Kanheri Caves demonstrate the Buddhist influence on the art and culture of India. Kanheri comes from the SanskritKrishnagiri, which means black mountain. They were chiseled out of a massivebasaltic  rock outcropping.<br> <br>These caves date from the first century BCE to the 10th century CE. One hundred nine caves have been carved from the basalt. Unlike the elegant splendor of the adjacent Elephanta Caves, the earlier cells are spartan and unadorned. <br><br>http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kanheri_Caves"

It is located in the archaeological region of the Petén Basin in what is now no<br>rthern Guatemala. Situated in the department of El Petén, the site is part of Guatemala's Tikal National Park and in 1979 it was declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site.<br><br>Tikal was the capital of a conquest state that became one of the most powerful kingdoms of the ancient Maya Though monumental architecture at the site dates back as far as the 4th century BC, Tikal reached its apogee during the Classic Period, ca. 200 to 900 AD. During this time, the city dominated much of the Maya region politically, economically, and militarily, while interacting with areas throughout Mesoamerica such as the great metropolis of Teotihuacan in the distant Valley of Mexico. There is evidence that Tikal was conquered by Teotihuacan in the 4th century AD. Following the end of the Late Classic Period, no new major monuments were built at Tikal and there is evidence that elite palaces were burned. These events were coupled with a gradual population decline, culminating with the site’s abandonment by the end of the 10th century.<br><br>http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tikal"

        "description": "Phnom Bakhen at Angkor, Cambodia, is a Hindu temple in the form of a temple mountain. Dedicated to Shiva, it was built at the end of the 9th century, during the reign of King Yasovarman (889-910). Located atop a hill, it is nowadays a popul<br>ar tourist spot for sunset views of the much bigger temple Angkor Wat, which lies amid the jungle about 1.5 km to the southeast. The large number of visitors makes Phnom Bakheng one of the most threatened monuments of Angkor.<br><br>Constructed more than two centuries before Angkor Wat, Phnom Bakheng was in its day the principal temple of the Angkor region, historians believe. It was the architectural centerpiece of a new capital, Yasodharapura, that Yasovarman built when he moved the court from the capital Hariharalaya in the Roluos area located to the southeast.<br><br>Jean Filliozat of the Ecole Francaise, a leading authority on Indian cosmology and astronomy, interpreted the symbolism of the temple. The temple sits on a rectangular base and rises in five levels and is crowned by five main towers. One hundred four smaller towers are distributed over the lower four levels, placed so symmetrically that only 33 can be seen from the center of any side. Thirty-three is the number of gods who dwelt on Mount Meru. Phnom Bakheng's total number of towers is also significant. The center one represents the axis of the world and the 108 smaller ones represent the four lunar phases, each with 27 days. The seven levels of the monument represent the seven heavens and each terrace contains 12 towers which represent the 12-year cycle of Jupiter. According to University of Chicago scholar Paul Wheatley, it is \"an astronomical calendar in stone.\" <br><br>http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ellora_Caves<br><br>http://youtu.be/vmQP69exo1o"

        "description": "Developed from 205 BC, the original kovil combined key features to form its basic Dravidian temple plan, such as its thousand pillared hall – \"Aayiram Kaal Mandapam\" – and the Jagati expanded by King Elara Manu Needhi Cholan. Regarded as the greatest building of its age for its architecture, elaborate sculptural bas-relief ornamentation adorned a black granite megalith while its multiple gold plated gopuram towers were expanded in the medieval period. One of three major Hindu shrines on the promontory with a colossal gopuram tower, it stood distinctly on the cape’s highest eminence. The journey for pilgrims in the town begins at the opening of Konesar Road and follows a path through courtyard shrines of the compound to the deities Bhadrakali, Ganesh, Vishnu Thirumal, Surya, Raavana, Ambal-Shakti, Murukan and Shiva who presides at the promontory’s height. The annual Koneswaram Temple Ther Thiruvilah festival involves the Bhadrakali temple of Trincomalee, the Pavanasam Theertham at the preserved Papanasuchunai holy well and the proximal Back Bay Sea (Theertham Karatkarai) surrounding Konesar Malai.<br><br>The complex was destroyed in colonial religious attacks between 1622 and 1624 and a fort was built at the site from its debris. A 1632 built temple located away from the city houses some of its original idols. Worldwide interest was renewed following the discovery of its underwater and land ruins, sculptures and Chola bronzes by archaeologists and Arthur C. Clarke. It has been preserved through restorations, most recently in the 1950s. Granted ownership of villages in its floruit to form the Trincomalee District, Trincomalee village is located on the cape isthmus within the compounds. The modern temple has been a source of conflict between the majority Sinhalese and minority Tamils due to its position in a geostrategically important area. Revenue from the temple provides services and food to local residents.<br><br>Koneswaram has many strong historical associations. The shrine is described in the Vayu Purana, the Konesar Kalvettu and Tevaram hymns by Sambandhar and Sundarar as a Paadal Petra Sthalam along with its west coast counterpart Ketheeswaram temple, Mannar, it is the birthplace of Patanjali, the compiler of the Yoga Sutras and was praised for its tradition by Arunagirinathar upon his visit. The Dakshina Kailasa Puranam and Manmiam works note it as Dakshina/Then Kailasam (Mount Kailash of the South) for its longitudinal position and pre-eminence, it lies directly east of Kudiramalai west coast Hindu port town, while it is the easternmost shrine of the five ancient Iswarams of Shiva on the island. Mentioned as a widely popular bay temple of the island in the Mahabharata, Ramayana and Yalpana Vaipava Malai, the Mattakallappu Manmiam confirms its sacred status for all Hindus. Kachiyappa Sivachariar’s Kanda Puranam compares the temple to Thillai Chidambaram Temple and Mount Kailash in Saivite esteem. Konesar Malai may have been the site where Yoga originated; some scholars have suggested that the worship of the almighty god Eiswara on the promontory is the most ancient form of worship existing.<br><br>http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Koneswaram_temple"

Entry is free but car parking is charged for visitors who are not members of the National Trust.<br>There are many variations of rock formations, caused by Millstone Grit being eroded by water, glaciation and wind, most of which have achieved amazing shapes.

The caves may also be known as the Dunhuang Caves, however, this term is also used to include other Buddhist cave sites in the Dunhuang area, such as the Western Thousand Buddha Caves, and the Yulin Caves farther away. The caves contain some of the finest examples of Buddhist art spanning a period of 1,000 years. The first caves were dug out 366 CE as places of Buddhist meditation and worship. The Mogao Caves are the best known of the Chinese Buddhist grottoes and, along with Longmen Grottoes and Yungang Grottoes, are one of the three famous ancient Buddhist sculptural sites of China.<br><br>An important cache of documents was discovered in 1900 in the so-called \"Library Cave\", which had been walled-up in the 11th century. The content of the library was dispersed around the world, and largest collections are now found in Beijing, London, Paris and Berlin, and the International Dunhuang Project exists to coordinate and collect scholarly work on the Dunhuang manuscripts and other material. The caves themselves are now a popular tourist destination, with a number open for visiting.<br><br> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mogao_Caves"

These correspondences were for two dates—circa 4,800 BC and at precessional opposition—representing how the sky \"moves\" long term. Brophy proposes that the circle was constructed and used circa the later date, and the dual date representation was a conceptual representation of the motion of the sky over a precession cycle.<br>Near the calendar circle, which is made of smaller stones, there are alignments of large megalithic stones. The southerly lines of these megaliths, Brophy shows, aligned to the same stars as represented in the calendar circle, all at the same epoch, circa 6270 BC. The calendar circle correlation with Orion's belt occurred between 6400 BC and 4900 BC, matching the radio-carbon dating of campfires around the circle.<br><br>http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nabta_Playa"

The architecture is somewhat unusual from typical Classical central lowlands Maya sites. Lubaantun's structures are mostly built of large stone blocks laid with no mortar, primarily black slate rather than the limestone typical of the region. Several structures have distinctive \"in-and-out masonry\"; each tier is built with a batter, every second course projecting slightly beyond the course below it. Corners of the step-pyramids are usually rounded, and lack stone structures atop the pyramids; presumably some had structures of perishable materials in ancient times.<br>The centre of the site is on a large artificially raised platform between two small rivers; it has often been noted that the situation is well-suited to military defence. The ancient name of the site is currently unknown; \"Lubaantun\" is a modern Maya name meaning \"place of fallen stones\".<br><br>http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lubaantun"

Dahlin's work focused primarily on the bajo swamps and mapping, while Matheny's team focused primarily on excavations in the site center and architecture. This project ended in 1983. To the surprise of the archaeologists, it was found that a large amount of construction was not contemporary with the large Maya classic cities in the area, like Tikal and Uaxactun, but rather from centuries earlier in the Pre-Classic era (see: Mesoamerican chronology).<br><br>http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/El_Mirador"

It is located in the present-day department of Petén, Guatemala, west of the border with Belize and is the northern most of the three sites that form the Cultural Triangle with Yaxha and Nakum. The city lies along the Mopan and Holmul rivers. Naranjo was the capital of the most powerful Classic Maya kingdom of Saal. The ancient Classic Maya language name for the city was Wak Kab'nal and Maxam but the distinction between these two is still unclear. The divine owner of the city, its patron, and the founder of the dynasty was a deity with a yet-undeciphered name, nicknamed \"Black Square-Nosed Beastie\" (possibly read as Ik' Miin)<br><br>http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naranjo,_Guatemala"

It was found in 1898 in the largely rural township of Solem, Douglas County, Minnesota, and named after the nearest settlement, Kensington. Almost all Runologists and experts in Scandinavian linguistics consider the runestone to be a hoax. The runestone has been analyzed and dismissed repeatedly without local effect.

According to legend, during Roman times it was used to isolate thousands of plague victims, and during the three occasions when the Black Death spread through Europe, the island was effectively used as a lazaretto and plague pit – it was considered an efficient way of keeping the infected people separated from the healthy. According to this version, over 160,000 people died on the island throughout its history. The island used in 1576 to accommodate those hit by the plague was not Poveglia, but Lazzaretto Nuovo. <br>Another legend surrounds a building erected in 1922 on the island, which was used for various purposes, including usage as a mental hospital. The legend states that a particular mental health doctor tortured and butchered many of the patients, before going \"mad\" and jumping to his death from the bell tower. According to that same legend, he survived the fall, but was 'strangled by a mist that came up from the ground'. Its ruins remain to this day. The institution in question has been described as a retirement home, but evidence on the island shows that despite the controversy, at least part of the building housed mental patients.<br>The island has been featured on the paranormal reality shows Death in Venice: Demon Doctor, Ghost Adventures and Scariest Places on Earth.<br><br>http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poveglia"

Another legend tells of a battle long ago between the Blackfoot and the Cree in which a retreating Cree \"Medicine Man\" lost his headdress in the South Saskatchewan River.<br>A number of factors have always made Medicine Hat a natural gathering place. Prior to the arrival of Europeans the Blackfoot, Cree and Assiniboine nations used the area for hundreds of years.

In 1900, divers usually wore standard diving dresses — canvas suits and copper helmets – which allowed them to dive deeper and to stay submerged longer.<br><br>The Antikythera mechanism <br>The first to lay eyes on the shipwreck 60 meters down was Elias Stadiatos, who quickly signaled to be pulled to the surface. He described the scene as a heap of rotting corpses and horses lying on the sea bed. Thinking the diver had gone mad from too much carbon dioxide in his helmet, Kondos himself dove into the water, soon returning with a bronze arm of a statue. Until they could safely leave the island, the divers dislodged as many small artifacts as they could carry.<br><br> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antikythera_wreck<br>http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antikythera_mechanism<br><br><img src=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/umsh/AK-S7uFijvoh8B8k5Az37d6BJGyBcD476u_XERTTaZYFShyaFEgmqlB8jQF_BZOOZX_AA_1tkr9RK9h_uKp2rnutVYtOewuxt_BdZFEicjtj-0Ar5kP_mU9MBkFWZkpdUV_GIZZbBJ2wtlyW9qzH77qCZ3JI\" height=\"200\" width=\"auto\" />",

Zertal dates the site to 1160–1150 BCE, which conforms with the alleged date of the Sea Peoples' incursion to Israel, and the Biblical conflict between Sisera and Barak ben Avinoam (Judges 4-5). Zertal suggest that the site may have been the city of Harosheth Haggoyim, mentioned in Judge 4:2 as Sisera's place of residence.

The Church of the Nativity site's original basilica was completed in 339 CE and destroyed by fire during the Samaritan Revolts in the sixth century CE.

Another tradition relates that his mother was African (\"Abyssinian\"). Ali bin Al-Hasan is credited with founding the island city and with marrying the daughter of the local African king. Tradition also relates that it was the child of this union who founded the Kilwa Sultanate. Archaeological and documentary research has revealed that over the next few centuries, Kilwa grew to be a substantial city and the leading commercial entrepot on the southern half of the Swahili coast (roughly from the present Tanzanian-Kenya border southward to the mouth of the Zambezi River), trading extensively with states of the African hinterland and interior as far as Zimbabwe. Trade was mainly in gold, iron, ivory, and other animal products of the African interior for beads, textiles, jewelry, porcelain, and spices from Asia.<br><br>http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kilwa_Kisiwani"

It is a prototype of Burmese stupas, and consists of a circular gold leaf-gilded stupa surrounded by smaller temples and shrines. Construction of the Shwezigon Pagoda began during the reign of King Anawrahta and was completed in 1102 AD, during the reign of King Kyansittha of the Pagan Dynasty. The pagoda is believed to enshrine a bone and tooth of Gautama Buddha. Within the compound of the Shwezigon Pagoda is a stone pillar containing Mon language inscriptions dedicated by King Kyansittha.<br><br> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shwezigon_Pagoda"

Both Incas and Chanes suffered several raids from Guarani warriors that invaded the region from time to time. Eventually, the Guarani warriors conquered the plains and valleys of Santa Cruz and destroyed Samaipata. The Guaranis dominated the region well into the Spanish colonial period.<br><br>The most important feature of El Fuerte seems to be El Cascabel. El Cascabel can be translated as 'The Rattle'. Two parallel lines point to certain points in the eastern sky at a position of azimuth 71° and an altitude of about 6.75° . One could have looked along the parallel lines, standing on the place of observation in front of the Inca-wall at the foot of El Fuerte and watched the parallel rising of two planets at sunrise on August 20, 1066 above both lines against the background of constellation Leo: Venus and Jupiter. Some archaeologists contend that unusual carvings on the rocks may be from a pre-Inca civilization on this Amazonian slope who were commemorating the flyover of Halley's Comet in March 1066.<br><br> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/El_Fuerte_de_Samaipata"

Apollonia was founded in 588 BCE by Greek colonists from Corfu and Corinth on a site initially occupied by Illyrian tribes and was perhaps the most important of the several classical towns known as Apollonia. Apollonia flourished in the Roman period and was home to a renowned school of philosophy, but began to decline in the 3rd century AD when its harbor started silting up as a result of an earthquake.

The city was of uncertain foundation, Greek or Illyrian.<br><br>According to N.G.L. Hammond, Dimale was possible founded by King Pyrrhus of Epirus or by settlers from the nearby Greek colony of Apollonia.  M. B. Hatzopoulos believes that the non-Greek name of the city, the lack of any Greek founding legends associated with it and the mixed (colonial Greek, Greek from Epirus, non-Greek) onomastics of its inhabitants create the impression that Dimale had not a Greek character from the beginning, but was originally a Parthinian settlement that was hellenized under the influence of Epirus and Apollonia. Although, the city is frequently linked with the Parthini in various sources, it was never explicitly stated to be a city of that tribe.<br>During the Second Illyrian War in 219 BC, Demetrius of Pharos, after expelling all his Illyrian opponents from Dimale, fortified the city against an imminent Roman attack and left to defend Pharos. In spite of the fortress of Dimale being considered impregnable, the Romans, under the command of L. Aemilius Paullus, captured the city in a seven-day siege with local Illyrian help. After Demetrius' complete defeat at Roman hands and ultimate flight to Macedonia, Dimale entered into a friendly relationship (amicitia) with Rome.<br><br> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dimale"

Aristotle's Politics several times draws for examples on the internal government of Epidamnos, which was run as a tight oligarchy that appointed a ruling magistrate; tradesmen and craftsmen were excluded from power, until internal strife produced a more democratic government. The exiled oligarchs appealed to Corcyra while the democrats enlisted the help of Corinth, initiating a struggle between the two mother cities described by Thucydides as a cause of the Peloponnesian War . Individual trading with the local Illyrians was forbidden at Epidamnos: all traffic was through the authorized city agent or poletes. In the fourth century BCE the city-state was part of the kingdoms of Cassander and Pyrrhus. The general vicinity of Epidamus was called Epidamnia.<br><br> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epidamnos"

The inhabitants of Cerros constructed an extensive canal system and utilized raised-field agriculture.<br><br>From the time of its inception in the Late Preclassic Era, around 400BC, the site of Cerros was a small village of farmers, fishermen and traders. They made use of its fertile soils and easy access to the sea, while producing and trading product amongst the other Maya in the area. Around 50 BC, as their economy grew and they began to experiment with the idea of kingship, the inhabitants of Cerros initiated a great urban renewal program, burying their homes to make way for a group of temples and plazas.<br><br>http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cerros"

The site is that of a farming village with a long occupational history stretching back to approximately 1200 BC, during the Middle Preclassic period. Its inhabitants lived in pole-and-thatch houses that were built on top of low plaster-coated platforms. The site contains residential groups clustered around central patios. It also features the remains of a steam bath dating to approximately 900 BC, making it the oldest steam bath found to date in the Maya lowlands. Human burials have been associated with the residential structures; the oldest have no surviving burial relics, but from 900 BC onwards, they were accompanied by offerings of ceramic vessels.<br><br>http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cuello"

The ruins of the city can be found today in Budapest, the capital city of Hungary. It is believed that Marcus Aurelius may have written at least part of his book Meditations at Aquincum.<br>Originally settled by the Eravisci, a Celtic tribe, Aquincum served as a military base (castrum), having been part of the Roman border protection system called \"limes\". Around AD 41-54, a 500-strong cavalry unit arrived, and a Roman legion of 6,000 men was stationed here by AD 89. The city gradually grew around the fortress, and after Pannonia was reorganised by the Romans in AD 106, Aquincum became the capital city of Pannonia Inferior.<br><br>http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aquincum"

It is home to the ruins of Innisfallen Abbey, one of the most impressive archaeological remains dating from the early Christian period found in the Killarney National Park. The monastery was founded in 640 by St. Finian the Leper, and was occupied for approximately 850 years. Over a period of about 300 of these, the monks wrote the Annals of Innisfallen, which chronicle the early history of Ireland as it was known to the monks. The monks were dispossessed of the abbey on August 18, 1594, by Elizabeth I.<br>The location of the monastery on the island is thought to have given rise to the name Lough Leane (Irish Loch Léin), which in English means \"Lake of Learning\". According to tradition the Irish High King Brian Boru received his education at Innisfallen under Maelsuthain O'Carroll. Maelsuthain has been credited as the possible originator of the Annals.<br><br>http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Innisfallen_Island"

The spiritual and cultural beauty of these magnificent carvings towers above the deep waters of the Great Lake. <br>In the late 1970s master carver Matahi Whakataka-Brightwell came to his mother's land at Lake Taupō. On a boat trip around the Western Bays he saw the cliffs at Mine Bay and decided to use them as a canvas for his work.<br>Matahi decided to carve a likeness of Ngatoroirangi, a visionary Maori navigator who guided the Tuwharetoa and Te Arawa tribes to the Taupō area over a thousand years ago. In recognition of the multi-cultural nature of New Zealand, Matahi also carved two smaller figures of Celtic design, which depict the south wind and a mermaid. The Ngatoroirangi carving took four summers to complete and the carvers took no payment other than donations to cover the cost of the scaffolding. The carving has become an important cultural attraction for the region and is a wonderful gift to the local people and visitors alike.<br><br>http://www.greatlaketaupo.com/new-zealand/Maorirockcarving/<br>http://www.newzealand.com/int/article/mine-bay-rock-carving/"

Despite the lack of true evidence that she ever existed, it is believed that she lived around 960 – 920 BC. The Koran also refers to this queen who visited king Solomon in Jeruzalem [The Old Testament, 1 Kings, 10; 2 Chronicles 9] however, the very few excavations so far delivered no evidence yet.<br><br>The temple is surrounded by a wall of 260 meters length which is about 3,5 meters thick and may have once reached about 16 meters. In the hall of the temple there are still a few of the 32 pillars that once supported the roof. The 8 monumental pillars that seems to watch the site as fierce guards look like as they have been casted as concrete. The knobs on the top of the pillars indicate that the pillars once were fixed to buttresses.<br><br>Archaeologists have dated the site to 1500 – 1200 BC and possible older, definitely older than the times of Solomon and the Queen of Sheba. Here, five mighty pillars rise above the site.

The local jungle men were afraid of the cave for the whistling sound it makes from the underground river. It was not until 2009 that it became public after a group of British scientists from the British Cave Research Association, led by Howard and Deb Limbert, conducted a survey in Phong Nha-Kẻ Bàng from April 10 through April 14, 2009. Their progress was stopped by a large calcite wall.<br>According to the Limberts, this cave is five times larger than the Phong Nha cave, previously considered the biggest cave in Vietnam. The biggest chamber of Sơn Đoòng is more than five kilometers long, 200 meters high, and 150 meters wide. With these dimensions, Sơn Đoòng overtakes Deer Cave in Malaysia to take the title of the world's largest cave.<br><br>http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Son_Doong_Cave"

Occupation at the site dates back as far as the Early Classic period (AD 250–600) of Mesoamerican history. Zaculeu was the capital of the Postclassic Mam kingdom, and was conquered by the K'iche' Kingdom of Q'umarkaj, displaying a mixture of Mam and K'iche' style architecture. In AD 1525 the city was attacked by Spanish conquistadors under Gonzalo de Alvarado y Contreras during a siege that lasted several months. Kayb'il B'alam, the city's last ruler, finally surrendered due to starvation.<br>The site contains a number of temple-pyramids with talud-tablero style architecture and double stairways. The pyramids and governmental palaces are grouped around a series of plazas, and the site also possesses a ballcourt for playing the Mesoamerican ballgame.The site was originally fortified with walls.<br>The site was restored by the United Fruit Company in the late 1940s. It is open to tourists and includes a small museum. <br><br>http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zaculeu"

After abandonment during Late Preclassic and Early Classic, the site was resettled from the Late to Terminal Classic (A.D. 600 – 950). Abandoned again, it was reoccupied in the Late Postclassic by the Mayan peoples who survived the unexplained 10th century collapse of Classic Mayan Civilisation and migrated from Mayapan in Yucatán after the collapse of this city in the fifteenth century. These people, the Ko'woj Maya, brought their distinctive pottery and constructed typical Mayapan temple assemblages with a raised shrine lying at a right angle to a western facing temple rather than facing it,a very different pattern to ceremonial architecture outside central Peten. This civilisation flourished and remained independent of Spanish domination until late into the 17th century, usually recorded as 1697.<br><br>http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zacpeten"

It takes its name from the Sungai Batu or Batu River, which flows past the hill. Batu Caves is also the name of the nearby village.<br>The cave is one of the most popular Hindu shrines outside India, dedicated to Lord Murugan. It is the focal point of Hindu festival of Thaipusam in Malaysia.<br><br>The limestone forming Batu Caves is said to be around 400 million years old. Some of the cave entrances were used as shelters by the indigenous Temuan people (a tribe of Orang Asli).<br>As early as 1860, Chinese settlers began excavating guano for fertilising their vegetable patches. However, they became famous only after the limestone hills were recorded by colonial authorities including Daly and Syers as well as American Naturalist, William Hornaday in 1878.<br>Batu Caves was promoted as a place of worship by K. Thamboosamy Pillai, an Indian trader. He was inspired by the 'vel'-shaped entrance of the main cave and was inspired to dedicate a temple to Lord Murugan within the caves. In 1890, Pillai, who also founded the Sri Mahamariamman Temple, Kuala Lumpur, installed the murti (consecrated statue) of Sri Subramania Swamy in what is today known as the Temple Cave. Since 1892, the Thaipusam festival in the Tamil month of Thai (which falls in late January/early February) has been celebrated there.<br>Wooden steps up to the Temple Cave were built in 1920 and have since been replaced by 272 concrete steps. Of the various cave temples that comprise the site, the largest and best known is the Temple or Cathedral Cave, so named because it houses several Hindu shrines beneath its high vaulted ceiling.<br><br>http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batu_Caves"

        "description": "The Miami Circle, also known as The Miami River Circle, Brickell Point, or The Miami Circle at Brickell Point Site, is an archaeological site  in Downtown Miami, Florida. It consists of a perfect circle measuring 38 feet (11.5m) of 600 postmolds that contain 24 holes or basins cut into the limestone bedrock, on a coastal spit of land, surrounded by a large number of other 'minor' holes. It is the only known evidence of a prehistoric permanent structure cut into the bedrock in the United States, and considerably predates other known permanent settlements on the East Coast. It is believed to have been the location of a structure, built by theTequesta (also Tekesta) Indians, in what was possibly their capital. Discovered in 1998, the site is believed to be somewhere between 1700 and 2000 years old. Some scholars have questioned both its age and its authenticity.<br><br>Artifacts recovered from the Miami Circle site are stored and on display at History Miami. It is the official repository for all archaeological materials recovered in Miami-Dade County.<br>In order to date the site, pieces of burnt wood were sent in March 1999 for radiocarbon dating by John Ricisak, a specialist in the County Historic Preservation department. The results were a surprise, indicating that the wood was between 1800–2000 years old. Some scholars doubt that the circle is as old as the wood. Further evidence to support the theory that the holes were of that age comes from Tom Scott and Harvey Means of the Florida Geological Survey, who point to the buildup of a calcite 'duricrust' on the edge of the cut face. Though this is an extremely imprecise way to date the holes, it rules out that they were of modern origin.<br><br>Initial theories on the origin of the site were that it was created by the Olmec or Mayan civilizations. This theory was based on the fact there is little evidence of indigenous peoples in North America building permanent structures 2000 years ago. No evidence was found of any artifacts of Central American origin, however. Further examination of the artifacts found at the site, particularly the shell tools, shark teeth, and other items of aquatic origin, showed that they matched perfectly with artifacts known to be from a local tribe, the historic Tequesta.<br>The Tequesta were a tribe who were believed to be primarily nomadic, hunting fish and alligators in the Florida Everglades. They were considered aggressive as they killed many early European explorers who attempted landfall in Florida. The Tequesta, like many other Native Americans, succumbed to the new infectious diseases brought by European colonists, as well as were disrupted by warfare.<br><br>http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miami_Circle"

The rock is noted for its petroglyphs (\"primarily lines, geometric shapes, and schematic drawings of people, along with writing, both verified and not.\") carved designs of ancient and uncertain origin, and the controversy about their creators. In 1963, during construction of a coffer dam, state officials removed the rock from the river for preservation. It was installed in a museum in a nearby park, Dighton Rock State Park. In 1980 it was listed on the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP).<br>The boulder was most likely deposited in the riverbed during the last Ice Age, approximately 10,000-13,000 years ago. The boulder has the form of a slanted, six-sided block, approximately 5 feet (1.5 m) high, 9.5 feet (2.9 m) wide, and 11 feet (3.4 m) long. It is gray-brown crystalline sandstone of medium to coarse texture. The surface with the inscriptions has a trapezoidal face and is inclined 70 degrees to the northwest. It was found facing the water of the bay.<br>In 1680, the English colonist Rev. John Danforth, made a drawing of the petroglyphs, which has been preserved in the British Museum. His drawing conflicts with the reports of others and the current markings on the rock. In 1690 Rev. Cotton Mather described the rock in his book, The Wonderful Works of God Commemorated:<br>“Among the other Curiosities of New-England, one is that of a mighty Rock, on a perpendicular side whereof by a River, which at High Tide covers part of it, there are very deeply Engraved, no man alive knows How or When about half a score Lines, near Ten Foot Long, and a foot and half broad, filled with strange Characters: which would suggest as odd Thoughts about them that were here before us, as there are odd Shapes in that Elaborate Monument.…”<br><br>http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dighton_Rock"

Outside the church stands a stone cross from Tjora in Sola.<br>On 6 June 1992, the church was destroyed by arson; the first in a string of church burnings by members of the early Norwegian black metal scene. At first, the fire was thought to have been caused by lightning or an electrical failure. In 1994, Varg Vikernes of the one-man band Burzum was found guilty of burning Åsane Church and Storetveit Church in Bergen, the burning of Skjold Church in Vindafjord, and the burning of Holmenkollen Chapel in Oslo. He was also charged with the burning of Fantoft stave church, although the jurors voted not guilty. The judges called this an error but did not overthrow the whole case. A photograph of the church's burnt shell appears on the cover of the 1993 Burzum EP Aske (Norwegian for \"ashes\").

The monument first began to be constructed in the 11th century and continued to be built until the 14th century, spanning an area of 722 hectares (1,780 acres) which, at its peak, could have housed up to 18,000 people. Great Zimbabwe acted as a royal palace for the Zimbabwean monarch and would have been used as the seat of their political power. One of its most prominent features were its walls, some of which were over five metres high and which were constructed without mortar. Eventually the city was abandoned and fell into ruin.<br>The ruins were first encountered by Europeans in the late 19th century with investigation of the site starting in 1871.The monument caused great controversy amongst the archaeological world, with political pressure being put upon archaeologists by the government of Rhodesia to deny its construction by black people. Great Zimbabwe has since been adopted as a national monument by the Zimbabwean government, with the modern state being named after it. The word \"Great\" distinguishes the site from the many hundreds of small ruins, known as Zimbabwes, spread across the Zimbabwe Highveld. There are 200 such sites in southern Africa, such as Bumbusi in Zimbabwe and Manyikeni in Mozambique, with monumental, mortarless walls; Great Zimbabwe is the largest.<br><br>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Zimbabwe"

        "description": "Etowah Indian Mounds (9BR1) is a 54-acre (220,000 m2) archaeological site in Bartow County, Georgia south of Cartersville, in the United States. Built and occupied in three phases, from 1000–1550 CE, the prehistoric site is located on the north shore of the Etowah River. Etowah Indian Mounds Historic Site is a designated National Historic Landmark, managed by the Georgia Department of Natural Resources. It is the most intact Mississippian culture site in the Southeastern United States.<br><br>In the 19th century, European-American settlers mistakenly believed that the mounds had been built by the Cherokee, who then occupied the region; however, the Iroquoian-speaking tribe did not reach this part of Georgia until the late 18th century and could not have built the mounds.<br>Late 20th-century studies showed the mounds were built and occupied by prehistoric indigenous peoples  of the South Appalachian Mississippian culture (a regional variation of the Mississippian culture) of eastern North America. They were ancestors of the historic Muskogean language-speaking Muscogee (Creek) people who later emerged in the area. Etowah is a Muskogee word derived from italwa meaning \"town\". The federally recognized Muscogee (Creek) Nation and Poarch Band of Creek Indians consider Etalwa to be their most important ancestral town. From 1000–1550 CE, Etowah was occupied by a series of cycling chiefdoms over the course of five and a half centuries.<br><br>http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Etowah_Mounds"

The first, called Igbo Isaiah, was uncovered in 1938 by Isaiah Anozie a local villager, who stumbled upon the bronze works while digging beside his home. Subsequent excavations by Thurston Shaw in 1959 resulted in the discovery of two other sites, Igbo Richard and Igbo Jonah, containing the remains of an ancient culture. Artifacts have included jewelry, ceramics, a corpse adorned in what appears to be regalia, and many assorted bronze, copper, and iron objects. Some of these contain materials that are evidence of a long-distance trading system going to Egypt. Radiocarbon dating placed the sites around the 10th century or earlier, which would make the Igbo-Ukwu culture the earliest known examples of bronze casting in the region. The craftsmen were working centuries before those who made the more famous Ife bronzes.<br>The archaeological sites in southeastern Nigeria are associated with the Nri-Igbo. The three sites include Igbo Isaiah (a shrine), Igbo Richard (a burial chamber), and Igbo Jonah (a cache).<br><br>http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Igbo-Ukwu<br><br>http://archaeology.about.com/od/nigeria/Nigerian_Culture_History_and_Archaeology.htm"

Founded in 1518, it was the centre of shipping commerce in the Caribbean Sea during the latter half of the 17th century. It was destroyed by an earthquake in 1692 and subsequent fires, hurricanes, flooding, and another earthquake in 1907.<br><br>Port Royal was once home to privateers employed to nip at superpower Habsburg Spain's empire when smaller European powers dared not directly make war on Spain. As a port city, it was notorious for its gaudy displays of wealth and loose morals and was a popular homeport for the English and Dutch sponsored privateers to spend their treasure during the 17th century. When those governments abandoned the practice of issuing letters of marque against the Spanish treasure fleets and possessions in the later 16th century, many privateers turned pirate and used the city as their main base during the heyday of the Caribbean pirates in the 17th century. Pirates from around the world congregated at Port Royal coming from waters as far away as Madagascar.<br>After the 1692 disaster, Port Royal's commercial role was steadily taken over by the town (and later, city) of Kingston. Current plans for Port Royal will redevelop the small fishing town into a tourist destination serviced by cruise ships with archaeological findings at the heart of the attractions.<br><br>http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Port_Royal<br><br>http://all-that-is-interesting.com/post/8395804085/sunken-cities-of-the-ancient-world/2"

It is recognized as one of the Earth's largest known eruptions. The related catastrophe hypothesis holds that this event plunged the planet into a 6-to-10-year volcanic winter and possibly an additional 1,000-year cooling episode. This change in temperature is hypothesized to have resulted in the world's human population being reduced to 10,000 or even a mere 1,000 breeding pairs, creating a bottleneck in human evolution.<br><br>The Toba event is the most closely studied supereruption. In 1993, science journalist Ann Gibbons first suggested a link between the eruption and a bottleneck in human evolution. Michael R. Rampino of New York University and Stephen Self of the University of Hawaii at Manoa quickly lent their support to the idea. The theory was further developed in 1998 by Stanley H.

It is circular in form, roughly fifteen metres in diameter and three metres high. It is built in the same style as the Newgrange tomb, although on a smaller and less awe-inspiring scale. The structure is dome-shaped with an inset for the entrance and a small doorway, set almost one metre into the side of the monument. The doorway is framed with undecorated standing stones. As is common in passage tombs, this alignment allows for the rising sun to shine down the passageway at only two times of the year, illuminating the chamber within. At this mound, the passage is illuminated on the mornings of Samhain and Imbolc, at the beginning of November and February, respectively. Inside, the passage into the Mound of the Hostages stretches for four metres in length, one metre in width, and is 1.8 metres high. It contains decorated sillstones with images of swirls, circles, and x-patterns—designs associated with Mesolithic passage tomb art.

Discovered on December 18, 1994, it is considered one of the most significant prehistoric art sites.<br>The cave was first explored by a group of three speleologists: Eliette Brunel-Deschamps, Christian Hillaire, and Jean-Marie Chauvet, for whom it was named. Chauvet (1996) has a detailed account of the discovery. In addition to the paintings and other human evidence, they also discovered fossilized remains, prints, and markings from a variety of animals, some of which are now extinct. Further study by French archaeologist Jean Clottes has revealed much about the site. The dates have been a matter of dispute but a study published in 2012 supports placing the art in the Aurignacian period, approximately 30,000-32,000 BP.<br><br>http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chauvet_Cave<br>http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1664894/"

Due to its advantageous port conditions, its ease of defence and its good inland connections, Smyrna rose to prominence. The ancient city is located at two sites within modern İzmir, Turkey. The first site, probably founded indigenously, rose to prominence during the Archaic Period as one of the principal ancient Greek settlements in western Anatolia. The second, whose foundation is associated with Alexander the Great, reached metropolitan proportions during the period of the Roman Empire. Most of the present-day remains date from the Roman era, the majority from after a 2nd century AD earthquake.<br>In practical terms, a distinction is often made between Old Smyrna, the initial settlement founded around the 11th century BC, first as an Aeolian settlement, and later taken over and developed during the Archaic Period by the Ionians, and Smyrna proper, the new city moved into from the older one as of the 4th century BC and whose foundation was inspired, and perhaps also initiated, by Alexander the Great.<br><br>http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smyrna<br>http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seven_churches_of_Asia"

The name comes from Koine Greek  \"Θυάτειρα\" (Thuateira).The Turkish equivalent of Thyateira is Tepe Mezarlığı, meaning hill graveyard. It lies in the far west of Turkey, south of Istanbul and almost due east of Athens. It is about 50 miles (80 km) from the Mediterranean.<br><br>The city was known as \"Pelopia\" (Greek language: Πελοπία), but it was named Thyateira (Θυάτειρα) by king Seleucus I Nicator in 290 BC. He was at war with Lysimachus when he learned that his wife had given birth to a daughter. According to Stephanus of Byzantium, he called this city \"thuateira\" from Greek \"θυγατήρ\", \"θυγατέρα\" (thugater, thugatera), meaning \"daughter\", although it is likely that it is an older, Lydian name. In classical times, Thyatira stood on the border between Lydia and Mysia. It was famous for its dyeing and was a center of the indigo trade. Among the ancient ruins of the city, inscriptions have been found relating to the guild of dyers in the city. Indeed, more guilds are known in Thyatira than any other contemporary city in the Roman province of Asia (inscriptions mention the following: wool-workers, linen-workers, makers of outer garments, dyers, leather-workers, tanners, potters, bakers, slave-dealers, and bronze-smiths).<br>In early Christian times, Thyateira was home to a significant Christian church, mentioned as one of the seven Churches of the Book of Revelation in the Book of Revelation. According to Revelation, a woman named Jezebel (who called herself a prophetess) taught and seduced the Christians of Thyateira to commit sexual immorality and to eat things sacrificed to idols.<br><br><br>http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thyatira<br>http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seven_churches_of_Asia"

Sardis was the capital of the ancient kingdom of Lydia one of the important cities of the Persian Empire, the seat of a proconsul under the Roman Empire, and the metropolis of the province Lydia in later Roman and Byzantine times. As one of the Seven churches of Asia, it was addressed by the author of the Book of Revelation in terms which seem to imply that its population was notoriously soft and fainthearted. Its importance was due, first to its military strength, secondly to its situation on an important highway leading from the interior to the Aegean coast, and thirdly to its commanding the wide and fertile plain of the Hermus.<br><br>The earliest reference to Sardis is in the The Persians of Aeschylus (472 BC); in the Iliad the name Hyde seems to be given to the city of the Maeonian (i.e. Lydian) chiefs, and in later times Hyde was said to be the older name of Sardis, or the name of its citadel. It is, however, more probable that Sardis was not the original capital of the Maeonians, but that it became so amid the changes which produced the powerful Lydian empire of the 8th century BC.<br><br>http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sardis<br>http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seven_churches_of_Asia"

Today, it lies between 8–12 m beneath sea level in the Bay of Atlit at the mouth of the Oren river on the Carmel coast. It covers an area of ca. 40,000 m².<br>Underwater excavations have uncovered rectangular houses and a well. The site was covered by the eustatic rise of sea-levels after the end of the Ice age. It is assumed that the contemporary coast-line was about 1 km west of the present coast. Piles of fish ready for trade or storage have led scientists to conclude that the village was abandoned suddenly. An Italian study led by Maria Pareschi of the Italian National Institute of Geophysics and Volcanology in Pisa indicates that a volcanic collapse of the Eastern flank of Mount Etna 8,500 years ago would likely have caused a 10-storey (40 m)tsunami to engulf some Mediterranean coastal cities within hours.

However the Incas decided to built two fortress to control the amazonic area near Beni River and Madeira river. First fortress was located near the city of Riberalta, Bolivia, and is known as Las Piedras fortress. In 2001, two researchers from the University of Helsinki, Dr. Ari Siiriäinen (archaeologist) and Dr. Martti Pärssinen (historian), put forward a hypothesis according to which the Paititi legend was related to the Inca expeditions into the Amazonian jungle and to the possible Inca military presence in the region of the Beni and the Madre de Dios rivers. In order to test this hypothesis, a joint Finnish-Bolivian archaeological expedition was carried out in 2001–3 to investigate the fortified site Las Piedras near the town of Riberalta in the Eastern Bolivia. Some fragments of imperial Inca ceramics were found during the excavations but the presumed Inca origin of the site remains questionable.

It is roughly 27m in diameter.<br>The Broch has apparently changed its name, as it was known as Wooden's (read Odin) or Woden the Norse God) Hall in the 18th Century. This suggests that its association with Red Etin's (Edin) Hall is a later idea. Red Etin, according to Folklore Myths and Legends of Britain (Readers Digest), was a three headed giant who kidnapped the King of Scotland’s daughter and held her captive in his Hall. Two widows had 3 sons who quested to save the her from captivity. The first two sons were turned to stone - unable to answer the giants riddles - the third son answered the riddles and cut off the giants three heads with one blow of his axe; releasing the other sons and the King’s daughter from bondage. This is one of the most southerly broch survivals, which are more typically associated with Northern Scotland. Broch’s were multi floored defensive structures with room for cattle in the lower enclosure and accommodation on the upper floors accessed by passageways in the thick walls.<br>The broch’s location is a developed site with evidence of occupation covering the Iron Age and Roman occupation. The broch is situated in the NW corner of an earlier fort (probably the earliest feature of the site) 73M by 134M consisting of a double ring of defensive ditches and ramparts, overlooking a steep slope above the valley cut by Whiteadder water.<br><br>http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edins_Hall_Broch (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edin%27s_Hall_Broch)"

It is a remarkably well preserved broch - on the east side parts of the old wall still reaches to 9 metres tall.  In places there are also more modern repairs to the east wall. Dun Carloway was probably built some time in the 1st century BC, and radiocarbon dating evidence from remains found in the broch show that it was last occupied around 1300 AD. At the base the broch is around 14 to 15 metres in diameter and the walls around 3 metres thick. It has a circular plan and hollow walls and was built without mortar. It probably had wooden floors, internal partitions and a thatched roof, necessary to make it habitable, but the only remaining evidence of this are post-holes. Together with the roof, the narrow passageway presumably secured by a wooden door, were the most vulnerable points of the building, especially to fire.<br><br>http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dun_Carloway"

It is believed to have been founded about 800 AD, some 650 years earlier than Machu Picchu. This location is also known as Buritaca and the Native Americans call it Teyuna.<br>Ciudad Perdida was discovered in 1972, when a group of local treasure looters found a series of stone steps rising up the mountainside and followed them to an abandoned city which they named \"Green Hell\" or \"Wide Set\". When gold figurines and ceramic urns from this city began to appear in the local black market, authorities revealed the site in 1975.<br>Members of local tribes—the Arhuaco, the Koguis and the Asario —have stated that they visited the site regularly before it was widely discovered, but had kept quiet about it. They call the city Teyuna and believe it was the heart of a network of villages inhabited by their forebears, the Tairona. Ciudad Perdida was probably the region's political and manufacturing center on the Buritaca River and may have housed 2,000 to 8,000 people. It was apparently abandoned during the Spanish conquest.<br>Ciudad Perdida consists of a series of 169 terraces carved into the mountainside, a net of tiled roads and several small circular plazas. The entrance can only be accessed by a climb up some 1,200 stone steps through dense jungle.<br><br>http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ciudad_Perdida"

In its latest phase, lasting from about 1700–1500 BCE, it absorbed the Sudanese kingdom of Sai and became a sizable, populous empire rivaling Egypt. Around 1500 BCE, it was absorbed into the Egyptian Empire, but rebellions continued for centuries. By the 11th century BCE, the more 'Egyptianized' Kingdom of Kush emerged, apparently from Kerma, and regained the region's independence from Egypt.

The Jawa Dam, though, is the largest of the dams and withheld the largest reservoir. <br><br>http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jawa_Dam_Jordan (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jawa_Dam%2c_Jordan)"

The castle is named after its constructor, Jim Bishop. <br>The Castle is located in south central Colorado along a paved public road, State Highway 165, approximately 13 miles (21 km) southeast of the junction of State Highways 96 and 165. This road is part of the Frontier Pathways Scenic and Historic Byway, and Bishop Castle is shown on the official map.<br>Construction of the castle began in 1969, when Bishop began construction on a family cottage, which he decided to surround with rocks. Several neighbors noted that the structure looked something like a castle. Bishop took this into consideration and soon began building his castle. He had bought the land when he was fifteen for a price of $450. He has faced numerous challenges with the local and state government over ownership and activities on the site.<br><br>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bishop_Castle"

Throughout the ages the fortification has served a variety of somewhat differing uses: from defensive ringfort, to medieval safe haven and thence a cavalry garrison. In the 20th century it was further reconstructed to become a heavily visited tourist site and a location for re-enactment of medieval battles. Eketorp is the only one of the 19 known prehistoric fortifications on Öland that has been completely excavated, yielding a total of over 24,000 individual artifacts. The entirety of southern Öland has been designated as a World Heritage Site by UNESCO. The Eketorp fortification is often referred to as Eketorp Castle.<br><br>The indigenous peoples of the Iron Age constructed the original fortification about 400 AD, a period known to have engendered contact between Öland natives with Romans and other Europeans. The ringfort in that era is thought to have been a gathering place for religious ceremonies and also a place of refuge for the local agricultural community when an outside enemy appeared. The circular design was believed to be chosen because the terrain is so level that attack from any side was equally likely.<br><br>http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eketorp"

        "description": "Sannai-Maruyama site (三内丸山遺跡) is a Jōmon period archaeological site in Aomor, Aomori Prefecture, Japan. The site was discovered in 1992, when Aomori Prefecture started surveying a site for a planned baseball stadium. Archaeologists have used this site to further their understanding of the transition to sedentism and the life of the Jomon people. Excavation has led to the discovery of storage pits, above ground storage and long houses. These findings demonstrate a change in the structure of the community, architecture, and organizational behaviors of these people. <br><br>Sannai-Maruyama was first settled around 3900 BCE. The first settlers on the site lived in pit houses. These dwellings typically were about 3–4 meters (10–13 ft) in diameter. Over 500 pit dwellings have been found on site. Additionally, they stored their food in underground pits, which allowed them to hide it when they left the site since the occupants were not yet living a sedentary lifestyle.<br>Around 2900 BC, the way the site occupants lived and stored food began to change. They began to store food above ground in buildings rather than underground in pits. This change happened as they became more sedentary. Also, long houses began showing up around this time. Long houses were large, oval-shaped structures. The longest one found at the site was 32 meters long (105 ft). Scholars believe long houses were used for meeting places, workshops, or living space. Pit houses were still being inhabited at the same time that long houses existed on the landscape.<br>One of Sannai Maruyama’s most famous structures, the large six-pillared building, was built around 2,600 BC. This structure consisted of six large pillars that are believed to have held up platforms. Each one of these pillars was around 1 meter in diameter and was placed exactly 4.2 m (13.8 ft) apart. Due to its large size, it is believed that this structure functioned as a monument or watchtower. Remains of other six-pillared buildings from different time periods have been found throughout the site. Many of the post holes from these buildings overlap each other, which suggests that the structures were being rebuilt in the same location and facing the same direction.<br>The settlement of Sannai Maruyama ended around 2300 BCE.<br><br>http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sannai-Maruyama_site"

The mound's location on top of a small ridge, far from major bodies of water, is indicative that it was built by Adenan peoples, who often buried their chieftains in mounds such as the Luthor List Mound.

With a diameter of at least 75 feet (23 m) in all directions, it is 12 feet (3.7 m) high; the erosion caused by the plows of past farmers has not damaged the Luthor List Mound because of its location — sitting atop the ridgeline and covered with trees, it is not an ideal farming location.

A portion of Horseshoe Canyon containing The Great Gallery is part of a detached unit of Canyonlands National Park. <br><br>Human presence in Horseshoe Canyon has been dated as far back as 7000-9000 B.C., whenPaleo-Indians hunted large mammals such as Mastodons and Mammoths across the southwest. Later inhabitants included the Desert Archaic culture, the Fremont culture, and Ancestral Pueblo People. Occupation by the Fremont and Ancestral Puebloans was relatively brief; it is believed that the canyon was abandoned by Native American peoples by 1300 A.D.<br><br>http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horseshoe_Canyon_(Utah)"

A range of colours and high durability are found in the constituent clays of the ochre mined at Wilgie Mia. These are residual to a geological process involving haematite (Fe2O3) and other iron rich compounds.<br>Wilgie Mia ochre has been used in the production of rock art and other painting practices throughout many regions of Australia.

After being in Pátzcuaro  for the first years of the Tarascan empire, power was consolidated in Tzintzuntzan in the mid 15th century. The empire continued to grow and hold off attacks by the neighboring Aztec Empire, until the Spanish arrived. Not wanting to suffer the destruction that Aztec capital Tenochtitlan did, the emperor in this city surrendered to the Spanish. Eventually, much of the site and especially its distinct five rounded pyramids called “yacatas” were destroyed and the city almost completely abandoned. Due to lack of interest in the old P’urhépecha dominion, excavation of this site did not begin until the 1930s.<br> <br>The founding date of the city of Tzintzuntzan is most likely 1450, during the late post-classic period. The traditional history of the Empire for the 14th and 15th centuries is unclear because if it is to be believed, both Tarícuri and his nephews ruled for more than ninety years.<br><br>http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tzintzuntzan_(Mesoamerican_site)"

In their exhaustion, they forgot about their feud and became friends, but when they left they forgot to clean up the mess they had made during their battle, hence the Chocolate Hills.<br>A more romantic legend tells of a giant named Arogo who was extremely powerful and youthful. Arogo fell in love with Aloya, who was a simple mortal. Aloya's death caused Arogo much pain and misery, and in his sorrow he could not stop crying. When his tears dried, the Chocolate Hills were formed.<br>The third legend tells of a town being plagued by a giant carabao, who ate all of their crops. Finally having had enough, the townsfolk took all of their spoiled food and placed it in such a way that the carabao would not miss it. Sure enough, the carabao ate it, but his stomach couldn't handle the spoiled food, so he defecated, leaving behind him a mound of feces, until he had emptied his stomach of the food. The feces then dried, forming the Chocolate Hills.<br>The last legend is about a gluttonous giant named Miguel that eats everything in his path. One day he came to a plain. He saw a beautiful young woman named Adrianna. To win her affection, he needed to lose weight. So he excreted everything he ate. In the end, his fecal matter covered the land and he won Eng's affection.<br><br>http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chocolate_Hills"

Many ancient Bronze Age tomb mounds have been found in the area and have been associated with the Pazyryk culture which closely resembled that of the legendary Scythian people to the west.The term kurgan is in general usage to describe such log-barrow burials. Excavations of this site have continued to yield fascinating archaeological findings. One famous finding is known as the Ice Maiden, excavated by Russian archaeologist, Natalia Polosmak. Three tattooed mummies (c. 300 BC) were extracted from the permafrost of the Ukok Plateau in the second half of the 20th century.<br> <br>http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ukok_Plateau"

According to Vasilyev, they found the remains of an ancient brick fortress in the newly-found 9th and 10th century layers, which contained characterisric Khazaryurts. The investigated area covered more than 2 square kilometers. \"This is a hugely important discovery ...

Nine radiocarbon dates have been taken from Barriles, six of them clustering between A.D. 500-800 (or the Late Bugaba Phase). Pottery from this period was generally unpainted and occasionally included engraved, incised and appliqué decorations. Stone artifacts, including small chips created from the manufacture of stone tools (i.e. blades, axes, and metates), were generally made from andesite, basalt, rhyolite, and chert.

Karli's location in Maharashtra places it in a region that marks the division between North India and South India.  Buddhists, having become identified with commerce and manufacturing through their early association with traders, tended to locate their monastic establishments in natural geographic formations close to major trade routes so as to provide lodging houses for travelling traders.<br><br>http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karla_Caves"

The island, located on an arm of the Arabian Sea, consists of two groups of caves—the first is a large group of five Hindu caves, the second, a smaller group of two Buddhist caves. The Hindu caves contain rock cut stone sculptures, representing the Shaiva Hindu sect, dedicated to the god Shiva. <br><br>The rock cut architecture of the caves has been dated to between the 5th and 8th centuries, although the identity of the original builders is still a subject of debate. The caves are hewn from solid basalt rock. All the caves were also originally painted in the past, but now only traces remain.<br><br>http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elephanta_Caves"

        "description": "The Vela Incident — sometimes referred to as the South Atlantic Flash — was an unidentified \"double flash\" of light that was detected by an American Vela Hotel satellite on September 22, 1979 near the Prince Edward Islands or Antarctica. There is uncertainty as to the true nature of the flash though it is widely believed to have been the result of a nuclear detonation.<br>While a \"double flash\" signal is characteristic of a nuclear weapons test, the signal might have been a spurious electronic signal that was generated by an aging detector in an old satellite or a meteoroid hitting the Vela satellite. No corroboration of an explosion, such as the presence of nuclear byproducts in the air, was ever publicly acknowledged, even though there were numerous passes in the area by U.S. Air Force planes that were specifically designed to detect airborne radioactive dust. Other examiners of the data, including the Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA), the U.S. Naval Research Laboratory (NRL), and defense contractors, have come to the conclusion that the flash was a result of a nuclear detonation. Much of the information relating to the event remains classified. <br><br>The most widespread theory among those who believe that the flash was of nuclear origins was that it resulted from a joint South African and Israeli nuclear test. The topic remains highly disputed today.<br><br>http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vela_Incident"

The wide Hvítá rushes southward. About a kilometer above the falls it turns sharply to the right and flows down into a wide curved three-step \"staircase\" and then abruptly plunges in two stages (11 m and 21 m) into a crevice 32 m (105 ft) deep. The crevice, about 20 m (60 ft) wide, and 2.5 km in length, extends perpendicular to the flow of the river. The average amount of water running over this waterfall is 140 m³/s in the summertime and 80 m³/s in the wintertime. The highest flood measured was 2000 m³/s.<br>As one first approaches the falls, the crevice is obscured from view, so that it appears that a mighty river simply vanishes into the earth.<br><br> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gullfoss"

        "description": "Kuk Swamp is an archaeological site in New Guinea . Evidence for early agricultural drainage systems was found here, beginning about 9,000 years ago. Features such as pits, postholes and runnels have been found at the site, which provide evidence for early agriculture. Such features are consistent with planting, digging and tethering of plants. Evidence has been found of irrigation draining ditches dating back to 9,000 years ago, with a number of plants including taro grown, at what would have been the edge of its cultivable limit in the highlands. During this time, the people of Kuk Swamp transformed their landscape into an anthropogenic grassland suitable for agriculture.<br>From 6,900 - 6,400 years ago further evidence has been found for the cultivation of bananas and sugar cane. Archaeologists have used archaeobotanical evidence to confirm the cultivation of bananas. Many bananaphytoliths have been found in the cultivation plots of Kuk Swamp. Since bananas do not produce phytoliths in the same quantity and frequency as grass and other plants, researchers have been able to conclude that the abundance of banana phytoliths found in a managed grassed landscape between 6950 and 6550 years ago suggests deliberate planting. The bananas grown at Kuk Swamp were Eumusa bananas, which stemmed the most significant and largest group of banana domesticates. This makes Kuk Swamp one of the earliest sites for the development of agriculture in the world.<br><br>http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kuk_Swamp"

All previous buildings, including a necropolis, were razed and replaced, with the exception of the Temple of Ramses II.[4][2] Hadrian also had political motives for the creation of Antinoöpolis, which was to be the first Hellenic city in the Middle Nile region, thus serving as a bastion of Greek culture within the Egyptian area. To encourage Egyptians to integrate with this imported Greek culture, he permitted Greeks and Egyptians in the city to marry and allowed the main deity of Hir-we, Bes, to continue to be worshipped in Antinoöpolis alongside the new primary deity, Osiris-Antinoüs.[4]:150 He encouraged Greeks from elsewhere to settle in the new city, using various incentives to do so.[4]:199 The city was designed on a gridiron plan that was typical of Hellenic cities, and embellished with columns and many statues of Antinoüs, as well as a temple devoted to the deity.[4]:200–2<br><br>The city of Antinoöpolis was the centre of the official cult of Antinoüs. The city exhibited the Graeco-Roman architecture of Hadrian's age in immediate contrast with the Egyptian style. Hadrian proclaimed that games would be held at the city in Spring 131 in commemoration of Antinoüs. Known as the Antinoeia, they would be held annually for several centuries, being noted as the most important in Egypt. Events included athletic competitions, chariot and equestrian races, and artistic and musical festivals, with prizes including citizenship, money, tokens, and free lifetime maintenance.[4]:149; 205 Divine honours were paid in the Antinoeion to Antinoüs as a local deity, and games and chariot-races were annually exhibited in commemoration of his death and of Hadrian's sorrow. (Dictionary of Antiquities, s. v. Ἀντινόεια.) According to the Greek Menaea, it was at Antinoë that Saint Julian underwent martyrdom during the Persecutions of Diocletian.<br><br>The city was abandoned around the 10th century. It continued to host a massive Graeco-Roman temple until the 19th century, when it was destroyed to feed a cement works.[6] Over the centuries, stone from the Hadrianic city was removed for the construction of homes and mosques.[4]:206 By the 18th century, the ruins of Antinopolis were still visible, being recorded by such European travellers as Jesuit missionary Claude Sicard in 1715 and Edme-François Jomard the surveyor circa 1800.[4]:198 However, in the 19th century, Antinopolis was almost completely destroyed by local industrial production, as the chalk and limestone was burned for powder while stone was used in the construction of a nearby dam and sugar factory.[4]:207<br><br> <br>http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antinopolis"

It was located at modern Tell el-Dab'a in the northeastern region of the Nile Delta, at the juncture of the 8th, 14th, 19th and 20th Nomes. As the main course of the Nile migrated eastward, its position at the hub of Egypt's delta emporia made it a major administrative capital of the Hyksos and other traders. It was occupied from about 1783 to 1550 BC, or from the Thirteenth Dynasty of Egypt through the Second Intermediate Period of Egypt until its capture by Ahmose I, the first Pharaoh of the Eighteenth dynasty. The name in the Egyptian language of the 2nd millennium BC was probably pronounced *Ḥaʔat-Wūrat 'Great House' and denotes the capital of an administrative division of the land. Today, the name Hawara survives, referring to the site at the entrance to Faiyum. Alternatively, Clement of Alexandria referred to the name of this city as \"Athyria\".<br><br><br>http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avaris"

Dedicated to Vishnu, this 37.19 m high 9 storied tower is one of the most remarkable in India . It is built partly of red sand stone and partly of white marble and is enriched by numerous images of Hindu gods and goddesses with inscriptions at bottom of each.<br><br>http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vijay_Stambha"

Excavations at the site began in 2003. The site has provided evidence of housing, decorated stone slabs, a massive stone wall with foundations, and a large building described as a Neolithic \"cathedral\" or \"palace\". The site may have been occupied from as early as 3500 BC to the close of the Neolithic period more than a millennium and a half later.<br>According to project manager Nick Card, the discoveries are unparalleled in British prehistory, the complexity of finds is changing the \"whole vision of what the landscape was 5,000 years ago\" and that \"it’s of a scale that almost relates to the classical period in the Mediterranean with walled enclosure and walled precincts\". Additionally, according to archaeologists in general, the site could be more important than Stonehenge. <br><br>http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ness_of_Brodgar"

They are made of a nickel-steel alloy which does not occur naturally, and is of a composition that rules out meteoric origin. Some have only a thin shell a quarter of an inch thick, and when broken open are found filled with a strange spongy material that disintegrates into dust on contact with the air.<br><br>What makes all this very remarkable is that the spheroids were mined out of a layer of pyrophyllite rock, dated both geologically and by various radio-isotope dating techniques to at least 2.8 billion years old.<br><br>Adding mystery to mystery, Roelf Marx, curator of the South African Klerksdorp Museum, has discovered that the spheroid he has on exhibit slowly rotates on its axis by its own power, while locked in its display case and free of outside vibrations."

As the city was destroyed, the Aztecs built a new city that was then called Calixtlahuaca.<br>Lázaro Manuel Muñoz (over 200 years ago), stated that Matlatzincas or their nomad ancestors, visited this site at least 640 BCE (theory apparently consistent with Lorenzo Boturini) and that Otomi gatherer-hunter groups were here 3000 years ago, at the a large lake existed (now disappeared), and melting water was fed from the Nevado de Toluca.<br><br>http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calixtlahuaca"

Geological evidence suggests that this bridge is a former land connection between India and Sri Lanka.<br>The bridge is 18 miles (30 km) long and separates the Gulf of Mannar (southwest) from the Palk Strait (northeast). Some of the sandbanks are dry and the sea in the area is very shallow, being only 3 ft to 30 ft (1 m to 10 m) deep in places, which hinders navigation. It was reportedly passable on foot up to the 15th century until storms deepened the channel: temple records seem to say that Rama’s Bridge was completely above sea level until it broke in a cyclone in AD 1480.<br><br>http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adam's_Bridge"

This lake, which lies in a basalt impact structure, is both saline and alkaline in nature. Geologists, ecologists, archaeologists, naturalists and astronomers have reported several studies on the various aspects of this crater lake ecosystem. Lonar Lake has a mean diameter of 1.2 kilometres (3,900 ft) and is about 137 metres (449 ft) below the crater rim. The meteor crater rim is about 1.8 kilometres (5,900 ft) in diameter. The circular depression bears a saline water lake in its central portion. The crater's age is usually estimated to be 52,000 ± 6,000 years (Pleistocene), although a study published in 2010 gives an age of 570,000 ± 47,000 years.<br>The Smithsonian Institution, the United States Geological Survey, Geological Society of India, and University of Sagar and the Physical Research Laboratory have conducted extensive studies about the site.<br><br>http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lonar_crater_lake"

It highlights that this area of the island once hosted a civilisation worthy of that name. Enormous stone walls, as well as an ancient road network, which was paved and elevated in certain sections; promontory platforms with impressive ramps in front of the ocean; a hydraulic system with terraces; all of these things are of the same era and design of the pyramids, which my team has identified on the island of Mauritius. And that is not all: there are also worked caves with their axes aligned identically north-south, and shaped rocks overlooking the ocean. Since all these structures are in the same general area of the seven pyramids that have been discovered on the island, it is reasonable to conclude that everything was probably built by the same civilisation – and that this was done a long time ago.<br><br>http://www.gigalresearch.com/uk/complexe-ile-maurice.php"

The period of occupation spans from the end of the Neolithic era and the beginning of the Bronze Age, until around the Roman times in Corsica.<br><br>The site was discovered in 1946 by the owner of the land, Charles-Antoine Cesari. Systematic excavations started in 1954 by Roger Grosjean. Finds of arrow heads and pottery date earliest inhabitation to 3300 BC. Around 1500 BC, 2-3 metremenhirs were erected. They have been carved with representations of human faces, armour and weapons. It is thought the menhirs may have been erected to ward off an invasion of a group of people called the Torréens (Torreans (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torrean_civilization)). However this was unsuccessful: the menhirs were cast down, broken up and reused in some cases as building material by the Torréens. The Torréens built circular stone structures on the site, known as torri (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torri) (or torre (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torre)), which may have been used as temples. The torri are remarkably well preserved.<br><br>http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Filitosa"

The meaning of such wooden building is not known, it was probably built when the ancient native people settled; perhaps it was a building destined as a Telpochcalli, for military training, justice administration, or learning dances or music.[4] (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huapalcalco#cite_note-Tula1-4)<br>Men passed through the Bering Straits 40 thousand years, 30 thousand years ago, men reached the Mexican plains and about 13 thousand years ago, men reached Huapalcalco in the Hidalgo, State, where vestiges have been located that date back to that period.[3] (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huapalcalco#cite_note-Tula3-3)<br>However, Huapalcalco is a mesoamerican classical period (100 to 650 CE), formed part of the State Teotihuacan, however, both its architecture and pottery is not equal to Teotihuacan, i.e. there is Teotihuacan influence, but are not Teotihuacan. It is not known what culture built these monuments; it can only be said that it is closely related to the Teotihuacan culture and had influence of the cultures of the Gulf Coast.[1] (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huapalcalco#cite_note-INAH-1)<br><br><br>http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huapalcalco"

        "description": "Rai, or stone money, are large, circular stone disks carved out of limestone formed fromaragonite and calcite crystals. Rai stones were mined in Palau and transported for use to the island of Yap, Micronesia. They have been used in trade by the locals and are described by some observers as a form of currency.<br><br>Yapese quarried the limestone rocks from the islands of Palau and took them to Yap with canoes and rafts. There exists evidence that some limestone has been mined in Palau by Yapese circa 500 AD, but more widespread mining started in the time period of 1000–1400 AD. Local legend holds that the Yapese discovered the rock of Palau about 500–600 years ago when an expedition led by a man called Anagumang landed on Palau. Limestone was nonexistent in Yap and therefore very valuable to the Yapese.<br>First Anagumang ordered his men to cut stone into the shape of fish but eventually a circular shape was chosen, probably because it was easier to transport. A pole was put through the hole in the center of the stone so that laborers could carry the stone. The largest of the disks probably needed hundreds of men to transport.<br>Residents of Palau, in turn, required Yapese to pay in beads, coconut meat and copra or in the form of services for the privilege of quarrying.<br>It is unknown how long money stones have been used in Yap. Flat rocks have been found there that are up to 2000 years old, but the oldest do not resemble today's rai stones, and it is not known if they were used as money. It is nevertheless clear that the size of the stones grew sharply after European techniques and traders came to Yap. The stones may have evolved from smaller, carved beads.<br><br>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rai_stones"

The star was a popular symbol during the Soviet era (Kazakhstan was a part of the former Soviet Union until its dissolution in 1991). Stars were often used throughout the Soviet Union to decorate building facades, flags and monuments. (Several online comments had suggested the star shape was the abandoned site of a Soviet-era lakeside campground.)<br>The star in the Soviet-era lakeside park is marked by roadways that are now lined with trees, Usmanova explained, which make the star shape even more distinct in aerial photos.

It is best known for its \"cart ruts\" - a complex network of tracks gouged in the rock. The age and purpose of the tracks are still a mystery of Maltese history. In general, most archeologists presume that the site developed about 2000 BC after new settlers came over from Sicily to start the Bronze Age in Malta.<br>It is reported that the \"Clapham Junction\" nickname was given by an Englishman, who later reported that it reminded him of the busy railway station Clapham Junction in London.<br><br>The tracks (known and signposted in Malta as Cart Ruts) can be found in a number of sites on Malta and on Gozo. Busewdien in St Paul's Bay, Naxxar, San Gwann and Bidnija are good examples of cart tracks found on the Island of Malta. Gozo's best Cart Ruts are on the Ta’ Ċenċ plateau, Sannat. The Misraћ Gћar il-Kbir site near the Dingli Cliffs in the south of the island is probably the most impressive – they form here a real \"traffic jam\".<br>Also called cart ruts, they are up to 60 cm deep and have an average distance between them of 110 to 140 cm. Some cross while others form junctions. This creates the illusion of a great railway station switching yard.<br><br>A cart ruts junction at Ghar il-Kbir<br>There are numerous theories about how these tracks were created. The most discussed are the following:<br>- Goods were transported here on sledges which gouged the tracks into the rock.<br>- The tracks are real cart ruts for transporting goods.<br>- It is an irrigation system.<br>There are also other attempts to explain the tracks:-<br>- The Maltese archeologist Anthony Bonanno thinks that the ruts are devices of the Phoenicians, which would mean that the tracks were made more recently, in the 7th century BC.<br><br> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Misrah_Ghar_il-Kbir<br><br><img src=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/umsh/AK-S7uE2tx5lxUBzCAmyK3y9Tsa0tIVUMKWycweevNWoOjs7wVbXSKjT5TXR2mbWouC4u0nYA0VaH--r2_B_l2X09NG4YFE1mBibSAHLwPEjtnD8m7HvYBMi_R_r3zOam3HPKcop9Xwvib-bAP3JHuDrHZcXrw\" height=\"200\" width=\"auto\" />",

No archaeological evidence from it pre-dates the reign of Psusennes I (1039-991 BC), but many scholars think it originated in the late New Kingdom. Tanis's creation was most likely due to the silting up of the Nile branch that ran by Pi-Ramesses, which forced people to seek another area with access to water. Later on, Tanis would become known as Thebes of Lower Egypt.<br>The kings at Tanis saw themselves as the legitimate successors on the throne of Upper and Lower Egypt. They used traditional titles and displayed their royalty in building work, although that was insignificant when compared to activity at the height of the New Kingdom.<br><br>The Hebrew story of Moses’ being found in the marshes of the Nile River as told in Exodus 2:3-5 is commonly located at Tanis. However, the intent of those stories may be as spiritual as much as historical allegories, as no supporting archaeological evidence has been unearthed.

Much of it has been archaeologically excavated and partly restored or preserved for study and public viewing, as well as for various events. The site was never totally abandoned. The small village of Mavromati occupies what was the upper city around the fountain called klepsydra. Administrative structure and population figures refer primarily to it.<br><br>During the Bronze Age the palace at Pylos controlled Messinia politically and economically. A Linear B tablet from there, Cn3, mentions a region called Mezana in local Mycenaean Greek, from which groups of men named from places in the Peloponnesus each contributed one ox to an official named Diweus. These groups were members of the coast-watchers, a military or quasi-military unit that presumably were stationed to guard various locations on the coast. Their failure is attested by the burning of Pylos a few months later by assailants unknown from the sea.<br><br>http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Messene"

Pavlopetri submerged town is located between the Pavlopetri islet across the Elafonisos village and the Pounta coast. The coast, the archeological site as well as the islet and the surrounding sea area are within the region of the Elafonisos Municipality, the old “Onou Gnathos” peninsula (according to Pausanias). It is unique in having an almost complete town plan, including streets, buildings, and tombs.<br><br>It has at least 15 buildings submerged in 3 to 4 metres (9.8–13 ft) of water. The newest discoveries in 2009 alone cover 9,000 m2 (2.2 acres). Earlier, the ruins were dated to the Mycenaean period, 1600-1100 BC. Later studies showed an older occupation date starting no later than 2800 BC, so it also includes early Bronze Age middle Minoan and transitional material.<br>It is now believed that the town was submerged around 1000 BC by the first of three earthquakes that the area suffered. The area never reemerged, so it was neither built-over nor disrupted by agriculture.<br><br><br>http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pavlopetri"

The site is located on a long (350 m), narrow projection into a bend of the river Šešuvis. The site is protected on the northeast and southwest by steep slopes, marshy banks, and the river. To protect it on the northwest, the only known Lithuanian double defensive system that uses earth and wooden outworks was erected on the projection’s neck. In all, it consisted of five ditches, four earthworks, and three levelled courtyards. A fortified settlement was built at the southeast end. In addition, the levelled hilltop areas were surrounded by palisades of sharpened poles. Artefacts dating from the early 1st century to the early second millennium were found during 21st century excavations. The site was eventually abandoned due to continued erosion and the shrinking hilltop.<br>Molavėnų II hillfort was built 400 m upstream in the 12th century on another projection at the confluence of the river Šešuvis and its tributary, the Jaujupis. Only the northeast and east sides were not protected by natural defences and so were instead guarded by a series of four earthworks and four ditches. A 20 m long earthwork with a corresponding ditch was constructed on the southwest slope. The flat hilltop was ringed by a wooden defensive wall. A tower was erected on the big earthwork, and wooden palisades on the other earthworks. A 2009 excavation discovered pottery dating to the 12th–14th centuries. Dry stone revetting was also found in one ditch.<br><br><br>http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molavenai (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molav%C4%97nai)"

During his travels along the south coast he saw the rock-island's beautiful setting and rested there. Some fishermen saw him, and bought him gifts. Nirartha then spent the night on the little island. Later he spoke to the fishermen and told them to build a shrine on the rock for he felt it to be a holy place to worship the Balinese sea gods.<br>The Tanah Lot temple was built and has been a part of Balinese mythology for centuries. The temple is one of seven sea temples around the Balinese coast. Each of the sea temples were established within eyesight of the next to form a chain along the south-western coast. However, the temple had significant Hindu  influence.<br>At the base of the rocky island, poisonous sea snakes are believed to guard the temple from evil spirits and intruders.

If it was a legend, some actual event, or anything else is anybody's guess now.<br>Guides intent on showing it to tourists are not sure of their bearings. They argue among themselves, insisting on absolutely different directions. What everybody agrees on is that Shaitan Zhiga is an extensive plateau of granite slabs stretching from the creeks of Mirankul in the direction of the settlement of Karatepe. Guides say that it is instantly recognizable. Its rocks look like sculptures - demons frozen in eternal dance, ancient idols, and prehistoric monsters turned to stone.<br>Old men call it a bad place. Either pagans and shamans used it for human sacrifice, or a fierce battle took place here once... but the skies caved in and caused an earthquake that transformed the mountains forever. Indeed, it is difficult to imagine that the granite rocks were shaped by the daily exposure to the sun, wind, and rains.

        "description": "The Ruins of Gedi are the remains of a Swahili town located in Gedi, a village near the coastal town of Malindi in Kenya.<br>From the 13th or 14th to 17th centuries, Gedi was a thriving community along the jungle coast of East Africa. Although no written record exists of this town, excavations between 1948 and 1958 revealed that the Muslim inhabitants traded with people from all over the world. Some of the findings included beads from Venice, coins and a Ming vase from China, an iron lamp from India, and scissors from Spain. The population was estimated to exceed at least 2500 people. These items can be found in the museum in the complex which was opened in 2000.<br>Gedi had a mosque, a palace, and large stone houses. These houses were complex for their time, with bathrooms with drains and overhead basins to flush toilets. The city's streets were laid out at right angles and had drainage gutters. There are also wells which supplied water to the community. The material used to construct the buildings was made from coral reef from the nearby ocean.<br>In the early 16th century, the village was abandoned. A possible explanation was that a punitive expedition came from Mombasa against Malindi and forced the inhabitants to leave. A temporary reoccupation likely occurred by the nomadic Oromo tribe from Somalia in the late 16th century, who later abandoned the town.<br><br>http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ruins_of_Gedi"

Another significant building located in the plaza is a ball court. Two parallel structures make up the ball court. The top rooms of the ball court were possibly used to store images of the gods associated with the events, along with items needed for the games.<br>Edzná was already inhabited in 400 BC, and it was abandoned circa 1500 AD. During the time of occupation, a government was set up whose power was legitimized by the relationship between governors and the deities. In the Late Classic period Edzná was part of the Calakmul  polity. Edzná may have been inhabited as early as 600 BC but it took until 200 AD before it developed into a major city. The word Edzná comes from \"House of the Itzás\" which may suggest that the city was influenced by the family Itzá long before they founded Chichen Itzá. The architectural style of this site shows signs of the Puuc style, even though it is far from the Puuc Hills sites. The decline and eventual abandonment of Edzná still remains a mystery today.<br><br>http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edzna"

The name Blå Jungfrun (Blue Virgin) was originally used by sailors to avoid provoking the evil spirits who dwelt on the island. According to a widespread belief, related already by Olaus Magnus in 1555, witches meet there each Maundy Thursday. Carolus Linnaeus, who visited the island in 1741, was sceptical:... women and fairy-tales ... generally say that all witches will go here (truly a rather difficult journey) each Maundy Thursday; but those who have visited the place once are not likely to return, and should find out the reason for the fable: If any place in the world looks hideous, this is surely one of the most cruel...<br>According to a still living tradition, anyone who removes a stone from the island will suffer from bad luck until it is returned. Oskarshamn yearly receives stone shipments from people, often with an accompanying letter of warning describing the misfortunes and disasters which happened to them after removing a stone.<br><br>http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bla_Jungfrun "

The citadel of Yapahuwa lying midway between Kurunagala and Anuradhapura was built around a huge granite rock rising abruptly almost a hundred meters above the surrounding lowlands.<br>In 1272, King Bhuvenakabahu transferred the capital from Polonnaruwa to Yapahuwa in the face of Dravidian invasions from South India, bringing the Sacred Tooth Relic with him. Following the death of King Bhuvenakabahu in 1284, the Pandyans of South India invaded Sri Lanka once again, and succeeded in capturing Sacred Tooth Relic. Following its capture, Yapahuwa was largely abandoned and inhabited by Buddhist monks and religious ascetics.<br><br>http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yapahuwa<br><br><img src=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/umsh/AK-S7uFa1a5HPMrP5zA-9ry87VL1pie6faGU37NBFhXKwDL82mqJdwaGA7vSl0iYR8VoaCQ2xJdxunXfgLRp1Ruc5vFxMI-1zigqu4AlxSN-3aKU7rGf3pycZK2-Jw4iOinfEA\" height=\"200\" width=\"auto\" /><br><br><img src=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/umsh/AK-S7uEXownlrPxAAtLXan9VrWP75RPN8icIa3S3FyaSk8I51eOnTyi3txP4WMc2LPC9nXsGtPp1UPuO9SF8d0mlq00iNCIZ-L9RK3W4R2y16NemIbad8ZSonGS7DykbZUKdOHAYoj8qgjV_e9RA3LJsb3LrFcDocIWx2orhCcZZoSc0kKnhQ9Qwu0O7ByCk\" height=\"200\" width=\"auto\" /><br><br><img src=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/umsh/AK-S7uE_Wqtb9XopmLZmwBLUrD0tmEYwBekoinhGv0FdZiGJ6eZnnaz52W78LGzy5BO037q7jnKlHlKhoXJ_jG-KvL_pA6tjQPK6-mCwSXuool870hzZvb25UUN2WHf_pHrZ9A\" height=\"200\" width=\"auto\" /><br><br><img src=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/umsh/AK-S7uFJGaX10rQ0_W2qk0HGj5Po1Z9l2AYU3tjhzotakcpApjdQHsUvKAFL0jo9wIu6gBtPtPj1xY5LW2585cbvF82Bmtz-VCu7zFx6CE016Zv1Ocdo0tcTgE4SMNzzaw2RM_o\" height=\"200\" width=\"auto\" />",

The center consisted of some 100 walled compounds on small islands on the inner reef platform with a total area of about 20 ha. Today the surviving ruins consist of the walls constructed in prismatic basalt in header and stretcher fashion of some chiefly compounds, the mortuary areas of the kings constructed in coral rubble and basalt paved ceremonial platforms, one principal access canal and some paved streets. The mortuary areas incorporate a number of basalt lined burial chambers. The final mortuary practices were at the nearbyYenasrIsland. The compounds are named and their traditional associations and functions are well known. <br><br><br>http://whc.unesco.org/en/tentativelists/5652/<br><br>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leluh_archaeological_site"

The pyramid is approximately 15 metres in height and built from blocks of the local granite. Not to be confused with the nearby natural rock formations known as the Pyramids in the Girraween National Park. It is on private property belonging to a local vineyard (Henty Estate) and is approximately 25 metres from the nearest road.[1] It was built by a former land owner at a cost of one thousand Australian dollars. [2] The pyramid was built after a local resident, Peter Watters (Watters Vine Management Service), asked what was to be done with the surplus amount of granite rocks that were excavated for land tillage. The pyramid took eight months to build using an excavator and dump truck.[3]<br><br>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ballandean_Pyramid"

It is the only temple whose forecourt, in front of the concave facade, is stone paved as is the entrance passage leading to the central court. Behind the temple and contemporary with it are small rooms possibly used for storerooms or the like, or even an irregular lobed minor temple. The most notable feature on the site is the 2.75 metre long 'trough' lying across the entrance to the left apse. It has seven deep transverse grooves produced by grinding. It is made of hard limestone brought from over 2 kilometres away so it is highly probable that it is for grinding corn (a multiple quern) and contemporary with the temple rather than for grinding 'deffun', the traditional Maltese roofing material, which would make it considerably more recent. The site is in a walled enclosure next to the church of St.Anthony and is kept locked to give it maximum protection.[1] (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paola,_Malta#cite_note-1)<br><br> <br>http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paola,_Malta#Kordin_III"

The bones are stuck into the ground and propped up by rocks, and archaeologists believe that down the middle of Whale Bone Alley were once huge skulls and square pits containing tonnes of meat.Nearly 40 years after it was first discovered, scientists still aren’t sure who built the mysterious structure and why, but, as the Express reports, the site has now become something of an archaeological tourist attraction. It's Siberia's slightly creepier answer to Stonehenge or the Pyramids.The leading theory is that Whale Bone Alley was once a shrine and sacred meeting place created by the local Inuits, known as the Yupik, who hunted whales for food. It's believed that it was built around the 14th century, during a temporary ice age that resulted in prolonged winter and food shortages.<br><br>http://www.sciencealert.com/welcome-to-whale-bone-alley-siberia-s-eerie-answer-to-stonehenge<br><br><img src=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/umsh/AK-S7uEnz_9txMG0a0PC0t_hG1RZTvOhxyqQzgIheHrtYNwzXlfXEo4aTGdMCPsxp3DNm9LOD8UiJbDlD2g9r8j1Az1O16N4iJOrjomsnshAPzDcqCS79KTbCh8\" height=\"200\" width=\"auto\" /><br><br><img src=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/umsh/AK-S7uE0L9SGVohQ047KMnIwEqx9mwDr0sUnwxiENlWhv-KsOGMvEJYXJohJLVWH-RubMKT8TaWo4fR9jwfzPRNNzyOytEk3ZmS_Pe71sATDVdQa0qi7LMQcLvpsyJnFZugb7R7F0Y0qfbe5dyo8vRumlsLp8YC1W6hOtiAjvC6Z\" height=\"200\" width=\"auto\" />",

It is believed to be part of the Great Zimbabwe tradition of architecture, distinguished by mortarless stone walls, and part of the famous Mwenu Mutapa’s Kingdom. <br>The central stone enclosure complex is built in this tradition, and the find of a Zimbabwe-style iron gong at the site also suggests cultural ties.The site today is covered by the Cenchrus Ciliaris grass, commonly found in Zimbabwe but not in Mozambique. Berger suggests that this may indicate the grass was introduced along with cattle from Zimbabwe. The site is located 350 km from Great Zimbabwe, the capital of a large, pre-colonial empire active from at least the 11th through the 14th centuries. Barker (1978) has suggested that only the ruling elite at Manyikeni consumed beef, as cattle bones have been found only in the central part of the site. The lower classes who lived at the periphery of the site ate meat from ovi-caprines. The presence of a large number of glass beads and seashells at the site have led to speculation that the settlement traded extensively with the ancient coastal settlement of Chibuene.Manyikeni is mentioned in a history book about Africa only once. Manyikeni is a Bantu word that means \"a place where people can trade together\".<br><br>http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manyikeni"

The Bumbusi National Monument consists of colossal stone walls, boulders, platforms and the ruins of dwellings. Its main structures date from the eighteenth and nineteenth century. Excavations in 2000 revealed the floors of eighteen original dwellings. The site was declared a National Monument in 1946. In 2008 it was listed in the World Monuments Watch List of 100 of Most Endangered Sites by the World Monuments Fund because of the threats posed to the sandstone walls by wild animals from the surrounding nature reserve.<br><br>http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bumbusi_National_Monument"

The art depicts certain creation ancestors as well as animals from the area such as barramundi, catfish, mullet, goannas, long-necked turtles, pig-nosed turtles, rock ringtail possums, and wallabies.From the top of Ubirr rock there is a panoramic view of the floodplains and escarpments.Ubirr is approximately 40 km from Jabiru along a sealed road. The road is low lying so access can be restricted during periods of heavy rain. A short walk from the car park takes visitors past the main art sites to the foot of Ubirr Rock.The rock faces at Ubirr have been continuously painted and repainted since 40,000 BCE. Most paintings there were created about 2000 years ago. Some have been repainted right up to modern times. There are three main galleries of art accessible to visitors.

        "description": "The Tibesti Mountains are a mountain range in the central Sahara, primarily located in the extreme north of Chad, with a small extension into southern Libya. The highest peak in the range, Emi Koussi, lies to the south at a height of 3,445 metres (11,302 ft) and is the highest point in both Chad and the Sahara. Bikku Bitti, the highest peak in Libya, is located in the north of the range. The central third of the Tibesti is of volcanic origin and consists of five shield volcanoes topped by large craters: Emi Koussi, Tarso Toon, Tarso Voon, Tarso Yega, and Toussidé. Major lava flows have formed vast plateaus that overlie Paleozoic sandstone. The volcanic activity was the result of a continental hotspot that arose during the Oligocene and continued in some places until the Holocene, creating fumaroles, hot springs, mud pools, and deposits of natron and sulfur. Erosion has shaped volcanic spires and carved an extensive network of canyons through which run rivers subject to highly irregular flows that are rapidly lost to the desert sands.<br><br>Tibesti, which means \"place where the mountain people live,\" is the domain of the Toubou people. The Toubou live mainly along the wadis, on rare oases where palm trees and limited grains grow. They harness the water that collects in gueltas, the supply of which is highly variable from year-to-year and decade-to-decade. The plateaus are used to graze livestock in the winter and harvest grain in the summer. Temperatures are high, although the altitude ensures that the range is cooler than the surrounding desert. The Toubou, who first appeared in the range in the 5th century BC, adapted to these conditions and turned the range into a large natural fortress. They arrived in several waves, taking refuge in times of conflict and dispersing in times of prosperity, although not without intense internal hostility at times.<br><br>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tibesti_Mountains"

It is 14 miles inland from the Pacific Ocean. The site covers a total area of 100 hectares, and is the largest Late Archaic construction in the Norte Chico region. Currently, the Pativilca-Huaraz highway divides the site. The current site consists of two mounds, the larger of which measures roughly two football fields in length. Near this larger mound were two standing stones, known as huancas, which are believed to hold some sacred ceremonial purpose. Huaricanga also served as a religious center, and residents would persuade fishermen and inhabitants of the nearby highlands to participate in seasonal rituals.<br><br>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huaricanga"

Early in the 12th century the Franks assumed control of the site and it was part of the newly formed Crusader state of the Principality of Antioch. The Crusaders undertook an extensive building programme, giving the castle much of its current appearance. In 1188 it fell to the forces of Saladin after a three-day siege. The castle was again besieged in 1287, this time both defender and belligerent were Mamluks.

This site is situated 148 kilometres (92 mi) east of Colombo and 72 kilometres (45 mi) north of Kandy. It is the largest and best-preserved cave temple complex in Sri Lanka. The rock towers 160 m over the surrounding plains.There are more than 80 documented caves in the surrounding area. Major attractions are spread over five caves, which contain statues and paintings. These paintings and statues are related to Gautama Buddha and his life. There are a total of 153 Buddha statues, three statues of Sri Lankan kings and four statues of gods and goddesses. The latter include Vishnu and the Ganesha. The murals cover an area of 2,100 square metres (23,000 sq ft). Depictions on the walls of the caves include the temptation by the demon Mara, and Buddha's first sermon.<br><br>Prehistoric Sri Lankans would have lived in these cave complexes before the arrival of Buddhism in Sri Lanka as there are burial sites with human skeletons about 2700 years old in this area, at Ibbankatuwa near the Dambulla cave complexes.<br><br>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dambulla_cave_temple"

Moreover, the local vegetation is somehow bizarre in appearance, like something out of a make-believe story with strangely shaped trees, and unexplained charring on tree stumps and branches.<br><br>The forest was named after a shepherd that disappeared in the area with a flock of two hundred sheep. Most people who live near the forest are afraid to enter it due to the stories and legends that have been handed down. They believe that those who visit the site will never return back home. Many of the locals who have been brave enough to venture into the forest complained of physical harm, including rashes, nausea, vomiting, migraines, burns, scratches, anxiety, and other unusual sensations.<br><br>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hoia_Forest<br><br>https://hoiabaciuforest.com/"

        "description": "The oceanic pole of inaccessibility is the place in the ocean that is farthest from land. It lies in the South Pacific Ocean, 2,688 km (1,670 mi) from the nearest lands: Ducie Island (part of the Pitcairn Islands) in the north, Motu Nui (part of the Easter Islands) in the northeast, and Maher Island (near the larger Siple Island, off the coast of Marie Byrd Land, Antarctica) in the south. \"Point Nemo\", Latin for \"no one\" and also a reference to Jules Verne's Captain Nemo, lies more than 1400 miles from the nearest land. This Oceanic Point of Inaccessibility was used by H. P. Lovecraft as R'lyeh, the earthly home of Cthulhu. The area is also known as a \"spacecraft cemetery\" because hundreds of decommissioned satellites, space stations, and other spacecraft have been deposited there upon re-entering the atmosphere. Point Nemo is relatively lifeless; its location within the South Pacific Gyre blocks nutrients from reaching the area, and being so far from land it gets little nutrient run-off from coastal waters. <br><br>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pole_of_inaccessibility"

        "description": "In de 17e eeuw vestigden rijke kooplieden zich al in het gebied, dat toen nog bestond uit een aantal afzonderlijke landgoederen. Zij kochten het land eerst als investering; met zandafgraving verdienden zij geld, en de resulterende bleekvelden ook. Pas in de 18de eeuw ontstond de wens voor een buitenplaats, waar men naartoe kon vluchten als de kanalen in de stad (eerst Haarlem, later Amsterdam) begonnen te stinken in de zomer. In deze bloeitijd van de buitenplaatsen is de bekende tuin van George Clifford geplant bij de Hartekamp, en de Haarlemmerhout opnieuw geplant door Henry Hope.<br><br>https://nl.wikipedia.org/wiki/Groenendaal_(Heemstede)"

In December 2007, a report was released by a team of Kyrgyz historians, led by Vladimir Ploskikh, vice president of the Kyrgyz Academy of Sciences, that archaeologists have discovered the remains of a 2500-year-old advanced civilization at the bottom of the Lake. The data and artifacts obtained suggest that the ancient city was a metropolis in its time. The discovery consisted of formidable walls, some stretching for 500 metres (1,600 ft) and traces of a large city with an area of several square kilometers. Other findings included Scythian burial mounds eroded over the centuries by waves, and numerous well-preserved artifacts, including bronze battleaxes, arrowheads, self-sharpening daggers, objects discarded by smiths, casting molds, and a faceted gold bar that was a monetary unit of the time.<br>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Issyk-Kul"

The Dutch West India Company captured it in 1637; in subsequent centuries it was mostly used for the slave trade.

It is known for high concentration of cultural remains of modern humans (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modern_humans) from beginning of Upper Paleolithic (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Upper_Paleolithic) era.<br>A layer of Campanian (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Campania) volcanic ash (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volcanic_ash) from about 40,000 years ago has been found above some of the finds, showing that \"unknown humans\" inhabited the site before this.[2] (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kostyonki,_Voronezh_Oblast#cite_note-Anikovich2007-2)[3] (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kostyonki,_Voronezh_Oblast#cite_note-3) The Earliest directly dated human remains from this site are dated to 32,600 ± 1,100 14C years and consist of tibia (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tibia) and fibula (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibula) with traits classifying the bones to European early modern humans (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cro-magnon).[4] (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kostyonki,_Voronezh_Oblast#cite_note-Higham2006-4)<br>In 2009, DNA was extracted from the remains of a male hunter-gatherer (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hunter-gatherer) who lived 30,000 years BP and died aged 20–25. His maternal lineage was found to be U2 (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haplogroup_U2_(mtDNA)#Haplogroup_U2). He was buried in an oval pit in a crouched position and covered with red ochre (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ochre).[5] (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kostyonki,_Voronezh_Oblast#cite_note-mtdnaU2-5)<br><br><br>According to John F.

        "description": "There is no curse. <br><br>The picture of the doors is not of this temple. This temple is in my hometown, which was the capital city of the old Travancore kingdom. I have been in this temple hundreds of times. There was always a rumor that the temple contained a huge treasure, but no one in living memory had actually seen it. My mother recounted hearing about the treasure from her great-grandmother. In 2011, a petition was filed in the Supreme Court to have the wealth of the temple audited. The court appointed a 6 member committee for this.<br><br>The temple is constructed entirely of huge granite stones, and beneath the sanctum of the main deity, there are underground vaults. Some of these vaults were in daily use for storage of ceremonial equipment and vessels, but others had not been opened in centuries. One of these vaults was opened for the audit and a large treasure was discovered. This vault (called vault-A by the auditors) could be accessed only after sliding away a massive granite block that took 7 people to move, and then oxygen was pumped inside the cellar before any one could enter. The treasure was kept in old wooden boxes, which had rotted away to dust and the gold and jewels were sitting in piles of this wood dust. The auditors carefully sifted the jewels and coins out of the dust, wrapped them in cloth and put them back in new boxes. These were devotional offerings made to the deity of the temple over many centuries - e.g. 18 foot long golden chains encrusted with diamonds and other jewelry that must at one time have been used to decorate the deity (18 foot long chain, because the main deity of Vishnu in resting pose in this temple is that big). Gold coins that were paid as offerings were also found, including Roman Empire 'Aureus' coins from the time of Augustus Caesar (2000 years ago there was a lot of spice trade between Travancore and Rome - Periplus Maris Erythraei written in the 1st century, was a mariners' handbook for navigation and trading between the red sea and the western coast of India). The value of the actual gold and jewels was estimated to be roughly around 22 billion USD. Later the media speculated that the value could be as high as 1 trillion USD based on the 2000 year historical value of the find - apparently this is the worlds largest collection of ancient jewelry! After the audit the treasure was left back in vault-A and it was re-sealed the way it was found, pending further guidance from the Supreme Court.<br><br>During the audit, one vault, numbered as vault-B by the auditors could not be opened. This vault-B has an ante-chamber which was opened as recently as the 1990s, but it has an inner vault, which has not been opened for centuries, like vault-A where the treasure was found. The royal family, which was against the audit for religious reasons, but could not refuse the Supreme court order, had provided the old keys for this chamber as well. To enter this vault, there is first a wooden door, followed by an iron door which has three locks. They were able to open two of the locks, but one was rusted shut. The plan was to return another day with cutting equipment but before that could happen, the royal family got an injunction from the Supreme Court to stop the audit. The royal family, which has been the custodian of this temple for all these centuries were very unhappy with the idea of bringing in metal cutting torches and violently opening this vault, especially since this vault sits directly beneath the main sanctum of a very sacred, very active temple that gets thousands of visitors a day.<br><br>This is why this vault-B alone has not been audited yet. But the media has spun fantastical tales about this vault-B - that there is a curse inscribed on the door, that it is because of this curse that Sundar Rajan, the person who originally petitioned the court for the audit died (he was a very old retired person that died of a tropical fever). There are ridiculous stories on social media that if the vault is opened, the sea will come in and flood the city, and even that alien space ships are hidden under that vault!<br><br>Here are some interviews with the members of the audit team (these are in Malayalam language - I could not find any interviews in English)<br><br>Retired judge C.S. Rajan, representative of the Supreme Court, describing the opening of the vaults and why vault-B could not be opened: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMfifZzg_WE<br><br>K. Jayakumar, a senior government official who was part of the audit team, describing the treasure - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=014gJQIFxmw<br><br>Prince Aditya Varma - the representative from the royal family in the audit team - also confirming why vault-B was not opened then - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tN_DJNc1MsI<br><br>Why does this temple alone have this much wealth today? Travancore is one of a few kingdoms in India that was never invaded by the muslim marauders who looted and destroyed most of the temples in northern India (e.g. just one invader - Mahmud of Ghazni carried away a treasure worth millions of dinars in 1025 AD from the Somnath Temple in Gujarat). It was also not invaded by colonial powers - e.g, in 1741 the king of Travancore defeated the Dutch in the battle of Colachel. Travancore remained an independent kingdom even during the British colonial period, having an alliance treaty with the East India Company. Also the kings were very serious about their religious duty. The great uncle of the prince in the video above, who was the ruler in 1947 when his kingdom was absorbed into the Indian Republic could have packed all this treasure and left to live in luxury elsewhere, but did not - so the treasure remains in this temple to this day. Nobody still knows what lies in vault-B - more treasure, or something as mundane as vessels used for temple ceremonies!"
